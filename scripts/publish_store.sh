# Publishes an MSIX to the Microsoft Store through the legacy submission API,
# and refuses whenever that API cannot carry the app's pricing unchanged.
#
# The API (manage.devcenter.microsoft.com/v1.0) predates Partner Center's
# market groups. For an app priced by market groups it returns
# `pricing.priceId: "Base"` and no market overrides — not "tier not set", but
# "this model cannot express what Partner Center holds". The whole object has
# to go back on PUT ("Pricing data was not provided" otherwise), and a PUT
# that carries "Base" is rejected. On 2026-09-07 this script answered that by
# deleting priceId and sending the rest; the API accepted a pricing object
# with no base tier and no overrides and published WSL Manager as FREE in all
# 240 markets, every market group gone (2.0.1 submission …31420, then 2.0.2
# as Submission 72). The comment that used to sit here — "the prices already
# sit on it server-side and stay exactly as they were" — was wrong.
#
# So: when the clone comes back with "Base", stop. The package then has to be
# updated by hand in Partner Center, where the pricing is left alone. When the
# clone carries a real tier, the object round-trips and publishing is safe.
#
# It also no longer deletes a pending submission it finds. On 2026-09-08 the
# one it deleted was the previous release, still in certification.
#
# The way out, documented by Microsoft only between the lines: the API does
# accept a base tier and per-market tiers *stated in its own terms*
# (priceId "Tier1012".."Tier1424" for the advanced model). With PRICING_FILE
# set, store/pricing.json is written into the clone (scripts/store_pricing.jq)
# instead of echoing what the API could not read, so the round trip is
# deterministic and the prices live in git. DRY_RUN=1 proves that without
# risk: it creates a submission, PUTs, reads the submission back, reports
# what the API stored against what was sent, and deletes the submission —
# nothing is uploaded and nothing is committed. Run it after any pricing
# change and before trusting a release to it.
#
# Required environment:
#   STORE_TENANT_ID  STORE_CLIENT_ID  STORE_CLIENT_SECRET  STORE_APP_ID
# Optional environment:
#   PRICING_FILE  path to a pricing file (see store/pricing.json); without it
#                 the clone's pricing must round-trip on its own (see above)
#   DRY_RUN=1     create, PUT, read back, report, delete; never upload/commit
# Argument:
#   $1  path to the .msix to publish (still required in a dry run, unused)
