# `check` answers, before the build replaces anything on the release,
# whether the tap can be read at all and which version the published cask
# advertises. `update` rewrites the cask's version and sha256, commits it,
# and reads it back to prove the change landed.
#
# The two halves exist because the failure they guard against is not the
# cask going stale on its own: it is a *new* dmg landing on a release the
# published cask already points at, while the tap cannot be written. The
# cask then advertises a checksum nothing serves and every
# `brew install --cask bostrot/tap/wsl-manager` dies with "Cask reports
# different checksum" (bostrot/ai-tasks#63 — HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN had expired,
# so three main builds in a row uploaded a freshly notarized 2.0.2 dmg that
# the cask could never follow).
#
# Environment:
#   TAP_TOKEN  token with contents:write on the tap — required.
#   TAP        owner/repo of the tap.         Default bostrot/homebrew-tap.
#   CASK_PATH  path to the cask in that repo. Default Casks/wsl-manager.rb.
#   GH_CLI     the gh binary; scripts/test_homebrew_cask.sh substitutes a
#              fake so the whole thing is exercised offline.
