// Answers "when did the Store hand this user the app?" for the Dart side.
//
// Once the Store listing is free, being installed from the Store no longer
// says whether the app was paid for. The Store itself still knows: every
// SKU a user owns carries the date it entered their collection
// (Windows.Services.Store, StoreSku.CollectionData.AcquiredDate), and for a
// copy bought while the listing cost money that date is the purchase. It is
// what lets a buyer who reinstalls on a fresh PC keep Pro, where nothing
// local is left to prove the purchase.
//
// The API is WinRT and only works with package identity, so this lives in
// the runner rather than in Dart. One method, `getAcquisition`, no
// arguments, answering a map:
//
//   acquiredAt  ISO-8601 UTC instant, or null when unknown
//   error       null, or a short reason nothing could be found
//
// Never throws at the Dart side: an unpackaged process, a sideloaded
// package, a user who is not signed in to the Store, an old Windows — all
// come back as an answer with `error` set and `acquiredAt` null.
