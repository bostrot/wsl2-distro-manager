# UI/UX click-through audit

Every screen, dialog and meaningful state of WSL Distro Manager, walked by hand in a
running build, screenshotted, and picked apart. This file is the index: the run
configuration that makes the walk reproducible, the master findings table, and the
ordered fix list that Phase 08 works from.

Findings live in the per-area files and are copied into the master table here. Each
finding carries a stable ID (`AREA-nn`) so a fix commit can cite it.

## Run configuration

Everything below was captured against this exact setup. Reproduce it before adding a
finding, or a screenshot will not be comparable with the ones already in the audit.

| | |
|:---|:---|
| Build | `flutter run -d windows --dart-define=WSLM_FORCE_PRO=true` (debug) |
| App version | 1.11.0 (`pubspec.yaml`), branch `beta` |
| Standard window | **1400 x 860** visible px -- above fluent_ui's 1008px open/compact nav threshold |
| Narrow window | **900 x 860** visible px -- deliberately below it, so the compact pane is audited too |
| Locale / theme baseline | `en` / light; other locales and dark are a separate pass ([[theme-and-locales]]) |
| Host | Windows 11 Pro 26200, 1 real distro (`Ubuntu`) + `ai-workspace` |
| Screenshots | `.maestro/screenshots/phase-07/` -- **gitignored, never committed** |

### The four commands

```powershell
$t = ".maestro\tools"
& "$t\prefs.ps1"  -Baseline -StopApp -Backup "$env:TEMP\wslm-prefs.json"
& "$t\launch.ps1" -Mode run -ForcePro -Width 1400 -Height 860 -KillFlutter
& "$t\resize.ps1" -Width 900 -Height 860          # narrow pass
& "$t\shot.ps1"   -Path ".maestro\screenshots\phase-07\<area>-<state>.png"
```

`prefs.ps1` (added by this phase) is the piece that makes the run *reproducible* rather
than merely repeatable. It refuses to touch `shared_preferences.json` while the app is
alive -- the app rewrites the file on exit, so an edit made mid-session is silently
discarded -- and `-Baseline` pins the state that otherwise varies run to run:

| Key | Baseline | Why |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `language` | `en` | The dev machine's saved locale is `de`; an audit that starts in German silently mixes the locale pass into every other pass |
| `themeMode` | `light` | Same reason, for [[theme-and-locales]] |
| `version` | pubspec version | Otherwise `initRoot` takes the version-changed branch |
| `LastChangelogVersion` | pubspec version | Suppresses the changelog dialog, which fetches from GitHub and lands on top of the first screenshot |
| `RatingPromptDone` | `true` | See below -- this one bites specifically *because* of `-ForcePro` |
| `LastMotd` | today | Suppresses the once-a-day motd status bar |
| `MoveOp_Distro`, `MoveOp_BackupPath` | removed | Suppresses the "Recovery Detected" dialog left behind by an interrupted move |

**`WSLM_FORCE_PRO=true` also makes the app look Store-installed.** The flag is read in
`LicenseManager._detectStoreInstall()` (`lib/api/license_manager.dart:70`), so it turns
`isStoreLicensed` -- not just `isPro` -- true. `maybeShowRatingPrompt()`
(`lib/dialogs/rating_dialog.dart:20`) gates on exactly that, and this machine has
`InstancesCreated = 27`, well past the threshold of 3. Result: the first launch of the
audit build opened on a modal rating dialog covering the centre of the window
(`00-baseline-1400x860-home.png`, first take). Pre-setting `RatingPromptDone` is what
removes it. Not a product bug -- a real Store user who has created 27 instances is meant
to see that prompt -- but it does mean **an unprepared `-ForcePro` run is not a clean
baseline.**

Pro reachability was verified rather than assumed: the License screen renders
"Pro Plan -- Bought once in the Microsoft Store" under the audit build
(`01-baseline-1400x860-license-pro-check.png`).

### Traps carried over from Phase 01

- `resize.ps1` uses `MoveWindow`, never `ShowWindow(SW_RESTORE)` -- the app restores its
  saved geometry a moment after the window appears and a restore-based resize loses the
  race, silently snapping back.
- `shot.ps1` captures `DWMWA_EXTENDED_FRAME_BOUNDS`, not `GetWindowRect`, so a "1400x860"
  request produces a 1400x860 PNG with no 7px desktop bleed on each edge.
- Other windows steal the foreground; `focus.ps1` escalates to minimising the thief. Do
  not take a screenshot without letting it run first -- the capture reads real screen
  pixels and bakes in anything overlapping.
- The toolkit scripts must stay pure ASCII (Windows PowerShell 5.1 reads a BOM-less file
  as ANSI, and one em dash then breaks a string dozens of lines away).

### Screenshot naming

`<nn>-<area>-<state>[-<theme|locale|width>].png`, e.g.
`02-baseline-900x860-home-narrow.png`. Findings cite the filename, not a path.

## Findings

All six passes are complete: **214 findings**, every one carrying an area, a
`file:line`, a severity, an effort estimate and either a screenshot or an explicit
`_measured_` / `_source-derived_` marker. Severity is
**blocker** (a user cannot complete the task, or the app looks broken) /
**major** (completable but confusing, wrong or ugly enough to notice) /
**nit** (polish). Effort is a rough implementation estimate for Phase 08.

| Area | Findings | blocker | major | nit | S | M | L |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| [[list-and-navigation]] | 26 | 0 | 12 | 14 | 23 | 3 | 0 |
| [[create-and-install]] | 40 | 0 | 23 | 17 | 33 | 7 | 0 |
| [[settings-and-tools]] | 62 | 2 | 25 | 35 | 58 | 4 | 0 |
| [[pro-surfaces]] | 46 | 5 | 25 | 16 | 39 | 6 | 1 |
| [[theme-and-locales]] | 18 | 3 | 9 | 6 | 13 | 5 | 0 |
| [[interaction-and-a11y]] | 22 | 4 | 13 | 5 | 15 | 7 | 0 |
| **Total** | **214** | **14** | **107** | **93** | **181** | **32** | **1** |

The [ordered fix list](#ordered-fix-list) below regroups all 214 by root cause into 20
work items -- that, not this table, is what Phase 08 works from.

| ST-19 | One click regenerates the MCP token -- no confirm, no toast, no notice that clients break (measured) | [[settings-and-tools]] | `settings_screen.dart:823` | major | S | `87`/`88-settings-mcp-token-*-crop.png` |
| ST-20 | The public-internet warning shows whenever MCP is on, contradicting the hint two lines above it | [[settings-and-tools]] | `settings_screen.dart:834` | major | S | `86-settings-mcp-on.png` |

## Ordered fix list

Input to Phase 08. **All 214 findings appear here exactly once** (verified by
`Working/batch_tally.dart`), grouped into 20 work items and ordered most impactful
first. The grouping is by *root cause and file*, not by audit area, because most
findings are one bug seen from several screens: 22 unnamed tap targets are one
`MergeSemantics` pass, six invisible controls are one theme-token pass, and eleven
"raw exception in the UI" findings are one error-mapping pass. Fixing them one screen
at a time would mean touching `notify.dart`, `theme.dart` and `en.json` twenty times
each.

Each work item is self-contained -- it can be a single commit and a single PR -- and
the `Fix` column is the change to make, not a restatement of the finding. Follow the
ID back to the master table above for the evidence and the screenshot.

### Progress

Each work item's own table carries a `Fixed in` column once it has been worked;
`--` means still open. Rolling total:

| Work item | Fixed | Open | Landed |
|:---|---:|---:|:---|
| FIX-03 -- One honest notification surface | 9 | 0 | 2026-08-28 |
| FIX-02 -- Report what actually happened | 10 | 0 | 2026-08-30 |
| FIX-01 -- Stop discarding what the user typed | 7 | 0 | 2026-08-28 |
| FIX-05 -- Error text a user can act on | 12 | 0 | 2026-08-28 |
| FIX-06 -- Keyboard operability | 9 | 0 | 2026-08-30 |
| FIX-07 -- Accessible names and honest tooltips | 10 | 0 | 2026-08-30 |
| FIX-04 -- Long operations: moving progress and a way out | 7 | 0 | 2026-08-30 |
| all others | 0 | 150 | -- |

**Why this order.** FIX-01 to FIX-05 are the ones where the app is *wrong*, not merely
awkward: work vanishes, a failure is reported as a success, a dialog body is the word
`Exception:`. FIX-06 and FIX-07 are the accessibility floor -- the app is currently not
operable by keyboard at all until the user clicks something, which is the single
worst finding in the audit. FIX-08 and FIX-09 are safety and consistency around
irreversible actions. FIX-10 to FIX-12 are cross-cutting passes that each close a
double-digit number of findings in one file. FIX-13 is the paid surface, which sells
two features that do not exist. FIX-14 onward is per-screen work that no longer blocks
anything else.

**Sequencing.** Four items are groundwork and should land before the ones that depend
on them:

- **FIX-03 before FIX-02 and FIX-05.** Both need a `Notify` layer that can express
  failure. Fixing the messages first means rewriting them again.
- **FIX-06 before re-checking LN-12.** LN-12 ("no focus ring on home") was re-diagnosed
  by IA-01: focus was never moving, so nothing could light up. It may close for free.
- **FIX-10 before FIX-13 / FIX-14 / FIX-17.** All three touch the same hardcoded
  `Colors.grey` / `Colors.orange` literals; do the token pass once.
- **FIX-11 before FIX-12.** No point restyling copy that is about to be re-keyed, and
  TL-10's widened CI gate will fail every string FIX-12 adds if it lands second.

**Findings that close together.** PS-40 and TL-16 are the same three missing i18n keys
from two directions. LN-10 and PS-10 are the same overlapping BETA badge. TL-06, PS-14
and LN-24 are the same invisible FAB in two themes. Six or so hours of the estimate
above is shared, not additive.

### FIX-01 -- Stop discarding what the user typed

Two blockers. The app throws away typed input on a navigation the user did not
understand to be destructive, and in one case navigates *itself*.

**Status: all 7 fixed.** The screen-level piece is a new
`UnsavedChangesGuard` (`lib/components/unsaved_changes.dart`): a dirty screen
registers a guard, and every exit route -- each nav-pane item, the app-bar back
button, the window X, and the two in-screen buttons that used to navigate on
their own -- goes through `navigateGuarded` / `confirmLeave` before the next
screen is built. `SettingsPageState` compares a draft snapshot against the last
saved one rather than asking a dozen controls to remember to set a flag, so the
"Unsaved changes" marker and the Discard button appear from the same source of
truth the prompt uses. The save-on-`dispose()` that was supposed to make leaving
commit -- and observably never fired, which is what made ST-01 a blocker rather
than a design choice -- is gone; the contract is now the Save button plus the
prompt. Regression tests: `test/unsaved_changes_test.dart`,
`test/settings_dialog_test.dart` ("Cancel actually cancels").

| ID | Sev | Fix | Fixed in |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| ST-01 | blocker | Track a dirty flag on the Settings draft and intercept every exit route (nav pane, back, window close) with a Save / Discard / Cancel prompt | `unsaved_changes.dart:14`, `unsaved_changes.dart:45`, `router.dart:22`, `panelist.dart:19`, `root_screen.dart:173`, `root_screen.dart:320`, `settings_screen.dart:137`, `settings_screen.dart:154` |
| PS-33 | blocker | Keep the typed question when Send hits a missing API key; offer the key inline or return to the panel with the text intact | `ai_chat_panel.dart:31`, `ai_chat_panel.dart:73`, `ai_chat_panel.dart:234` |
| ST-02 | major | Route language through the same draft-and-Save path as everything else, and apply it live rather than requiring a restart | `settings_screen.dart:331`, `settings_screen.dart:790`, `main.dart:226`, `en.json:154` |
| ST-03 | major | Save stays on the Settings page and confirms in place; it must not navigate to Home | `settings_screen.dart:531`, `settings_screen.dart:538` |
| ST-27 | major | Read `wsl.conf` without booting the distro, or say up front that opening settings will start it | `settings_dialog.dart:794`, `settings_dialog.dart:816` |
| ST-28 | major | Buffer per-distro `wsl.conf` edits and write them on Save, so Cancel actually cancels | `settings_dialog.dart:508`, `settings_dialog.dart:540`, `settings_dialog.dart:79`, `settings_dialog.dart:89` |
| PS-11 | major | The free MCP toggle must upsell in place; it may not navigate to License and drop unsaved settings on the way | `settings_screen.dart:941` |

Two carried consequences worth recording. **ST-27 is answered by asking, not by
avoiding the boot**: there is no way to read `/etc/wsl.conf` without `wsl.exe`,
so a stopped distro now gets a warning InfoBar and a "Start it and read the
settings" button instead of a silently started virtual machine. And **the
language picker previews without persisting**, which needed
`localeResolutionCallback` to prefer `AppTheme.locale` over the stored
preference -- otherwise the stored value would have overridden the preview on
the very rebuild the preview triggers.

### FIX-02 -- Report what actually happened

An operation that failed must not say it succeeded, and one that succeeded must not
leave a spinner running. `IA-13` is the root of the pattern: an `async void` API whose
`catch` is unreachable.

**Status: complete (10 of 10).** The last five were per-screen work in
`qa_dialog.dart`, `mount_dialog.dart`, `actions_screen.dart` and the AI
Workspace card; three of them were the same defect written out three times --
a primary button whose only response to an empty required field was to do
nothing at all.

| ID | Sev | Fix | Fixed in |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| IA-13 | blocker | Change `WSLApi.start` to return `Future<void>`, await it at the call site, and post the toast *after* it resolves -- `Future.delayed(d, Notify.message(...))` calls the function immediately, so remove the delay too | `wsl.dart:522`, `list_item.dart:187` |
| CI-12 | major | Validate the username when "Create default user" is ticked; never report success for a user that was not created | `create_dialog.dart:184`, `create_screen.dart:74` |
| CI-17 | major | Stop the "Creating instance..." spinner on the failure path | `create_dialog.dart:147` |
| CI-36 | major | Give the snippet download progress and a real failure state; a failed download may not close the dialog as if it worked | `qa_dialog.dart:57`, `qa_list.dart:89`, `qa_list.dart:67` |
| ST-53 | major | Replace the `// Error` no-op branch with a field-level validation message on the snippet name | `actions_screen.dart:239`, `actions_screen.dart:96` |
| ST-45 | major | A primary button may never silently no-op -- validate the required field and say what is missing | `mount_dialog.dart:94`, `mount_dialog.dart:134` |
| IA-12 | major | Show in-flight state for start / stop / delete, and only report DONE once the row is actually gone | `list_item.dart:41`, `list_item.dart:146`, `list_item.dart:473` |
| PS-19 | major | Move the card into an explicit "Installing" state for the duration of the install | `ai_workspace_screen.dart:535`, `ai_workspace_screen.dart:577` |
| PS-17 | major | Clear the status line when the operation it describes finishes -- it still read "Starting Open WebUI..." 105s after the tool was running | `root_screen.dart:82`, `service.dart:1090` |
| PS-32 | nit | A failed stop must leave the badge showing the state the tool is really in, not "running" in green | `service.dart:1193`, `service.dart:1201` |

### FIX-03 -- One honest notification surface

`Notify` is the single most-reused UI component in the app and it cannot express
failure. Everything downstream inherits that.

**Status: all 9 fixed.** `Notify.message` now takes an `InfoBarSeverity`
(re-exported from `notify.dart` so an `api/` file can name one without pulling
in fluent_ui), and `statusBuilder` stopped overriding fluent's per-severity
decoration with one flat colour. Regression tests: `test/notify_test.dart`.

| ID | Sev | Fix | Fixed in |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| CI-19 | major | Derive `InfoBarSeverity` from the message kind; "ERROR:" must not render with a blue info icon | `notify.dart:63`, `root_screen.dart:75` |
| PS-46 | major | Same at the toast layer -- one decoration for every outcome means install-failed looks like install-succeeded | `service.dart:849`, `service.dart:858` |
| CI-18 | major | Give status messages a lifetime and clear them on navigation | `notify.dart:26`, `root_screen.dart:82`, `root_screen.dart:111` |
| CI-24 | major | Lay the status bar out so it cannot cover the Create / Cancel row on a short window | `root_screen.dart:251` |
| IA-02 | major | An empty status bar must take no space, no tab stop and no clicks (currently an invisible 126x62 hit target on every screen) | `notify.dart:51` |
| IA-14 | major | The X on a running operation must cancel it, or not be offered -- hiding the progress while the work continues is worse than no control | `notify.dart:67` |
| CI-20 | nit | Drop the shouting `DONE:` / `ERROR:` / `WARNING:` prefixes now that severity is carried by the InfoBar | `en.json:30`-`79` |
| TL-14 | nit | Remove the eight divergent translations of `DONE:` along with it (Turkish renders it `TAMAM`) | `lib/i18n/*.json` |
| IA-15 | nit | Delete `statusMsg`'s unreachable `severity` parameter, or wire it to the new severity | `notify.dart:14`, `root_screen.dart:75` |

### FIX-04 -- Long operations: moving progress and a way out

Every operation over ~30 seconds in this app is uncancellable, and two of them freeze
their only progress indicator for minutes.

**Status: all 7 fixed.** The root of it is one new file, `lib/api/cancellation.dart`:
a `CancelSignal` that a UI control and the work it stops both hold. Deliberately not
`package:async`'s `CancelableOperation` -- what has to be cancelled here is a *child
process* and a *socket*, reached through a callback the worker registers while it owns
them, and a token is the only shape that survives being handed down four call levels
(screen → `createInstance` → `WSLApi.create` → the downloader) without each of them
returning a different type. It is named `CancelSignal` and not `CancelToken` because
`dio` exports a `CancelToken` of its own into both `wsl.dart` and the AI Workspace
service, and an ambiguous import is not a name worth defending.

Three things are worth recording. **A cancelled download does not throw**:
`ChunkedDownloader.stop()` breaks the read loop, deletes its own `.tmp` and lets
`start()` return *normally*, so the cancel has to be detected rather than caught -- read
as an exception it came out the far end as "the server returned an empty file", the
user's own cancel reported as a server fault. **A killed `wsl --import` can leave the
distro half-registered** -- it lists, it will not start, and its name cannot be reused --
so the cancel path unregisters it; that is also why the import moved off `Process.run`,
which hands back no handle to kill. And **`start` is not a program**: the `passwd`
console was spawned through `cmd /c start`, which hands its child to a new console and
exits at once, so the `await result.exitCode` that was already there awaited nothing.
`start "" /wait` makes it real, and `WSLApi.hasPassword` then asks the distro whether a
password was actually set, because closing that window without typing is silent.

The cheap paths are kept: `create` with no progress sink and no signal still goes
through `_runWsl`, and `CreateProgress.fraction` is null for an import rather than a
number, since an import has no percentage and inventing one is the CI-16 bug in a new
place. 14 new keys landed in all nine locales with real translations. Regression tests:
`test/long_operations_test.dart`.

| ID | Sev | Fix | Fixed in |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| CI-14 | major | Make Cancel work for the whole install; if it genuinely cannot, disable the nav pane too and say why | `create_screen.dart:271` (Cancel stops the install), `:95` (the nav pane, back button and window X now ask, via `UnsavedChangesGuard`), `wsl.dart:1535` (`_runImport` kills and unregisters), `cancellation.dart` |
| CI-16 | major | Report real progress across download *and* import instead of stalling at "Downloading 100%" | `create_screen.dart:186` (bar + phase line on the page), `wsl.dart:1654` (bytes and rate, not just a %), `wsl.dart:1548` (the import phase, with an elapsed clock) |
| PS-18 | major | Add cancel to the AI Workspace install and keep its progress line moving (measured: 2 minutes, 0 px changed) | `ai_workspace_screen.dart:628` (elapsed clock), `:634` (Stop), `ai_workspace/service.dart` (`installElapsed`, `cancelInstall`, cancel wired into `_runStreamed`) |
| CI-13 | major | Warn before spawning the external `passwd` console, and await it | `create_dialog.dart:890` (the form says a terminal will open), `wsl.dart:1367` (`start "" /wait`), `wsl.dart:1786` + `create_dialog.dart:444` (a passwordless account is reported, not silent) |
| LN-20 | nit | Centre the loading state where the results will land so content does not jump 330px; translate the string; offer cancel | `list.dart:207` (`Expanded`, like the other two branches), `:225` (Use local WSL); the string was already translated by FIX-05 |
| CI-15 | nit | Keep the Create button's width when it becomes a spinner | `components/busy_button.dart` (new), used at `create_screen.dart:258`, `create_dialog.dart:101`, `ai_workspace_screen.dart:755` |
| ST-36 | nit | Label the per-distro dialog's 4s+ spinner and disable Save while it runs | `settings_dialog.dart:863` (the spinner says what it is reading), `:100` (Save is disabled until `wsl.conf` has been read; Cancel stays live) |

### FIX-05 -- Error text a user can act on

Eleven findings, one rule: never put a raw exception in front of a user, and never
match on English text.

**Status: all 12 fixed.** The root of the work item is one new file,
`lib/api/wsl_errors.dart`: a `WslFailure` that reads *both* process streams,
pulls the stable `Wsl/…` code out of localized prose, maps it to a translated
sentence and keeps the tool's own words in `details`. `lib/components/error_view.dart`
is the matching surface -- the sentence in the primary position, "Technical
details" folded away underneath. Regression tests: `test/wsl_errors_test.dart`,
`test/error_view_test.dart`, plus the ST-07 case in `test/wsl_capabilities_test.dart`.

Three consequences worth recording. **The two streams are not interchangeable**:
stderr wins the text, because `wsl --import` paints a progress animation on
stdout and showing that instead of the reason is its own bug (already guarded by
`wsl_test.dart`'s "shows stderr on import failure") -- but stdout is read when
stderr is silent, which is the `--mount` case IA-16 is about, and its *code* is
taken whenever stderr carries none. **An unmapped failure gets no invented
sentence**: `explanation` is empty, and a caller with its own lead sentence
("Ubuntu could not be started.") appends the tool's first line rather than a
vague generic one, so nothing is lost on a surface too small for a disclosure.
And **IA-20's xterm half is answered by copying, not by installing**: that
terminal lives on the *host*, so the app cannot elevate to a package manager --
the dialog hands over the command instead of naming three packages and stopping.

| ID | Sev | Fix | Fixed in |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| IA-16 | blocker | `mount_service.dart:338` throws `Exception(result.stderr)`, but `wsl --mount` writes its reason (including the stable `Wsl/ERROR_*` code) to **stdout** -- read both streams, and never build a dialog body from a bare `Exception` | `wsl_errors.dart:79`, `mount_service.dart:288`, `mount_service.dart:339`, `mount_service.dart:354`, `mount_dialog.dart:156`, `mount_dialog.dart:212`, `mount_dialog.dart:242` |
| LN-17 | major | Translate the list-error strings and map the WSL error code to a sentence instead of dumping `Exception: ...` | `list.dart:137`, `list.dart:149`, `list.dart:211` |
| LN-18 | major | Offer a remedy and a route back to local WSL; Retry that repeats the same failure is not a recovery path | `list.dart:156`, `list.dart:176` |
| CI-22 | major | Map the WSL error code to a translated sentence; keep the raw stderr behind a "details" disclosure | `create_dialog.dart:46`, `create_dialog.dart:327`, `create_dialog.dart:514` |
| IA-17 | major | Stop interpolating raw exceptions into the five `docker_images.dart` messages -- two currently read "Error: Exception: ..." | `docker_images.dart:642`, `docker_images.dart:805`, `templates.dart:68`, `sync.dart:121`, `settings_dialog.dart:314`, `ai_workspace_screen.dart:585` |
| IA-18 | major | Move the sixteen hardcoded English messages into `en.json` and drop the implementation detail ("Exporting, removing and importing back...") | `list_item.dart:161`, `list_item.dart:198`, `list_item.dart:428`, `list_item.dart:448`, `list_item.dart:494`, `docker_images.dart:350`, `docker_images.dart:532`, `docker_images.dart:618`, `docker_images.dart:749`, `wsl.dart:508`, `wsl.dart:769`, `wsl.dart:823` |
| PS-31 | major | Translate the AI Workspace page-level failure and stop wrapping `Exception.toString()` | `ai_workspace_screen.dart:447` |
| IA-19 | major | Gate the "disk is offline" hint on the stable error code, not on English Windows text -- it can never fire on a localized host | `wsl_errors.dart:150`, `mount_dialog.dart:244` |
| ST-07 | major | Only surface "WSL reported:" for stderr that actually concerns `.wslconfig` | `wsl_capabilities.dart:151`, `wsl_capabilities.dart:156`, `settings_screen.dart:1457`, `settings_screen.dart:1467` |
| ST-22 | nit | Same treatment for the tunnel error, and use the theme's error colour rather than `Colors.red` | `settings_screen.dart:1059`, `settings_screen.dart:1088` |
| IA-20 | nit | Replace the "run `wsl --shutdown`" and "install xterm" prose with the buttons that do it | `settings_screen.dart:1281`, `wsl.dart:33`, `wsl.dart:844`, `en.json:117` |
| ST-13 | nit | Same string in Settings, 400px above the button that performs it | `settings_screen.dart:1281`, `en.json:117` |

### FIX-06 -- Keyboard operability

IA-01 is the audit's worst single finding: **the app cannot be operated by keyboard at
all until the user first clicks something**, and there is no keyboard route back.

**Status: all 9 fixed.** One new file, `lib/nav/shell_focus.dart`, carries the two
pieces that are not per-widget: `shouldAdoptKeyboardFocus()`, the one-line test for
the dead state IA-01 measured, and `ShellTraversalPolicy`, which sorts the shell's
chrome ahead of the page instead of leaving the navigation pane -- the first thing on
screen -- last in the cycle. `RootPageState` now wraps the whole `NavigationView` in
that group plus a `FocusScope` it owns, and hands the scope focus from a post-frame
callback in `initState` **and** from `onWindowFocus`; the second one is what fixes
the recurrence, since alt-tabbing away and back was enough to kill traversal again.
The check is deliberately conservative -- anything below the root scope, which is
every dialog, every text box and every clicked control, keeps its focus.

Three consequences worth recording. **The back arrow is not built at all when it
cannot pop** rather than being built disabled: that removes the dead tab stop (IA-03)
and the near-white "enabled-looking" disabled rendering (LN-13) together, and takes
the `NavigationPaneTheme` override and a `setState()` *inside* `build()` with it. The
arrow still appears on the pushed routes where `canPop()` is true.

**The chevron's ring is suppressed at the theme, not removed.** The Expander header is
one big `HoverButton` whose `FocusBorder` is drawn around the chevron alone, and whose
`states.isFocused` follows `hasFocus`, so any focused child lit it a second time --
IA-05's "1,100px away" and IA-06's two rings are the same fluent_ui behaviour seen
twice. `list_item.dart` wraps the Expander in a `FocusTheme` with `BorderSide.none`,
re-merges an empty `FocusThemeData` inside `leading:` and `content:` so the buttons
there keep the theme's ring, and draws the row's own ring around the whole card. Which
of the three regions holds focus is tracked by three non-traversable `Focus` watchers,
because "the header is focused" is only knowable as "the row is, and neither the
leading buttons nor the content are".

**IA-07 is a theme change, not 38 widget changes.** `buildAppTheme()` in `theme.dart`
now builds both brightnesses from one function -- the light and dark blocks in
`main.dart` were near-identical copies -- and gives the focus ring a 2px inner stroke
to match its 2px outer one. fluent_ui's default pairs a 2px outer stroke with a 1px
inner one, and the inner stroke is what separates the ring from whatever it is drawn
against; at 1px it read as the hairline the audit sampled.

Regression tests: `test/keyboard_focus_test.dart` (12), including a tab-cycle
assertion for the chrome-before-content order, a resolved-ring-width assertion for the
chevron, and a tree-wide scan that fails if an interactive `GestureDetector` comes
back.

| ID | Sev | Fix | Fixed in |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| IA-01 | blocker | Focus a real control at launch and on window activation instead of parking on the Root Focus Scope | `shell_focus.dart:28`, `root_screen.dart:115`, `root_screen.dart:121`, `root_screen.dart:296`, `root_screen.dart:301` |
| LN-12 | major | Re-verify after IA-01 -- the ring exists, focus was not moving. Likely closes for free; confirm with the Tab-diff capture | closed by IA-01 + IA-07; ring widened in `theme.dart:186` |
| IA-03 | major | Take the permanently disabled back arrow out of the tab order | `root_screen.dart:185` |

| IA-07 | nit | Widen the focus indicator to a 2px perimeter (WCAG 2.4.13) | `theme.dart:172`, `main.dart:203` |

### FIX-07 -- Accessible names and honest tooltips

The codebase contains **no `Semantics(label:)` at all** and 22 of 38 tap targets have
no accessible name. `list_item.dart` already does it right 11 times out of 11 -- copy
that pattern.

**Landed 2026-08-30.** The pattern is now one widget, `NamedIconButton`
(`lib/components/named_button.dart`), rather than eleven inline repetitions of it. It
exists because a `fluent_ui` `IconButton` opens its own semantics container: a
`Tooltip` wrapped round one is a sibling node, not a name, until `MergeSemantics`
folds the two together. The nineteen controls that were missing one half of that pair
or both went through the wrapper; the `list_item.dart` eleven that already did it by
hand were left alone, since rewriting them would have disturbed the per-region
`FocusTheme` work FIX-06 had just landed there.

**IA-09's trap was real and it was the tooltip, not the missing merge.** The editor
and terminal pickers sat inside a `Tooltip` whose message was the field's own
`InfoLabel` -- "Default editor" -- so merging the pair as written would have named the
*button* after the text box. Both tooltips were ST-14 offenders anyway (they restated
the label directly above them), so removing them fixed the naming and the noise in one
edit. Nine more tooltips on that screen said exactly what the control they wrapped
already said and are gone; the two that had something to add -- Stop WSL, which shuts
down every distro, and Edit .wslconfig, which opens a file in an external editor --
were rewritten to say it.

**IA-10 is three places, not a sweep.** An `Icon` carries no name, so anything that is
an icon and *not* a button was silent by construction: the licence table's check/cross
column, and the BETA and NEW pills, which announced four letters and no meaning. The
status pills were already `Text`. Both badges use `excludeSemantics: true` so the name
replaces the literal glyph rather than trailing it.

Regression tests: `test/accessible_names_test.dart` (5), including a tree-wide source
scan that fails if an icon-only tap target comes back without a name -- the same count
the audit made by hand, now enforced.

| ID | Sev | Fix | Fixed in |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| IA-09 | blocker | `MergeSemantics(Tooltip(...))` on the 22 unnamed tap targets; 11 are in `settings_screen.dart`, which has zero `MergeSemantics` today. Watch the trap at `:471` and `:499` -- those sit inside a `Tooltip` that describes the *TextBox*, not the button | `named_button.dart:15`, `settings_screen.dart:617` `:639` `:667` `:692` `:966` `:993` `:1005` `:1012` `:1104` `:1519` `:1721`, `mount_dialog.dart:448`, `template_screen.dart:183`, `ai_chat_panel.dart:159`, `recommendations_panel.dart:116`, `create_dialog.dart:700`, `settings_dialog.dart:616`, `package_screen.dart:509`, `ai_workspace_screen.dart:592` |
| IA-10 | major | Add `Semantics(label:)` where a visible tooltip is not appropriate | `license_screen.dart:260`, `beta_badge.dart:14`, `panelist.dart:95` |
| IA-11 | major | Tooltip the seven icon-only buttons that have none -- they are unlabelled for sighted users too | `named_button.dart:39` (label is the tooltip), call sites as IA-09 |
| ST-18 | major | Name the four MCP icon buttons and differentiate the two identical copy glyphs | `settings_screen.dart:966` `:993` `:1005` `:1012` |

| ST-14 | nit | A tooltip that repeats its own label is noise -- make it explain or remove it | `settings_screen.dart:364`, `:400`; nine removed at `:421` `:662` `:687` `:712` `:763` `:1143` `:1181` `:1200` `:1226` |
| PS-30 | nit | Same for the Open Dashboard tooltip | `ai_workspace_screen.dart:669`, `ai_workspace_screen.dart:760` |
| ST-30 | nit | Make the sync buttons' tooltips match their labels | `settings_dialog.dart:190`, `settings_dialog.dart:223` |

| ST-51 | nit | One folder glyph across all pickers, with a tooltip | `mount_dialog.dart:448` |

### FIX-08 -- Destructive actions must look and behave destructive

Nothing in this app that destroys data is styled differently from anything that does
not, and three destructive actions have no confirmation at all.

| ID | Sev | Fix |
|:---|:---|:---|
| ST-04 | major | Confirm "Stop WSL" (it shuts down every distro), move it away from Save, and write a tooltip that adds information |
| ST-19 | major | Confirm MCP token regeneration and state that existing clients break |
| LN-04 | major | Label the row's nine icon buttons, group them, move Delete out of the middle, and style it destructively |
| ST-29 | major | Style the four irreversible per-distro actions as actions, not as the Expander headers above them |
| PS-27 | major | Use the red destructive button for uninstall, as every other destructive dialog does |
| PS-35 | major | Confirm clear-chat-history, disable it when the history is empty, and give it a label |
| ST-38 | major | Write template-delete copy instead of reusing the distro string ("Delete instance ... permanently?") |
| ST-54 | major | Same for snippet delete |
| ST-46 | major | State that a physical mount needs elevation and detaches the disk from Windows -- before it fails |
| ST-40 | nit | Move the template delete next to the labelled buttons, give it a tooltip and destructive styling |
| PS-28 | nit | Name the tool inside the uninstall sentence rather than on a bare line above "this tool" |
| CI-31 | nit | Say that a copy duplicates the whole disk and stops the source distro |

### FIX-09 -- One dialog contract

Button order, primary styling, titles and sizing differ per dialog; the one that
deletes things is the one with the odd button order.

| ID | Sev | Fix |
|:---|:---|:---|
| ST-62 | major | One button order everywhere, including the delete dialog (Cancel is currently on the opposite side there) |
| CI-32 | major | Same for the community snippets dialog |
| CI-30 | major | Validate before popping, and stop using the source name as a placeholder -- the field looks pre-filled |
| CI-29 | nit | `FilledButton` for the copy dialog's primary action |
| CI-25 | nit | Keep the source-type flyout off the page title and the fields it belongs to |
| CI-28 | nit | Delete the dead `createDialog()` -- it also carries the opposite button order |
| CI-33 | nit | Give the community dialog a title |
| CI-37 | nit | Size it to its content instead of full window height |
| ST-32 | nit | Size the per-distro dialog to its twenty controls instead of a fixed 500x500 |
| ST-33 | nit | Title it with the distro name, not the bare word "Settings" |
| ST-43 | nit | Stop pre-filling the new-instance name box with the template's own name as a placeholder |

### FIX-10 -- Contrast and theme tokens

Twenty-one findings, one root cause: hardcoded `Colors.grey` / `Colors.orange` /
`Colors.red` literals spread across eleven files, plus a `systemTextColor` that assumes
light. Introduce the tokens once and most of this collapses.

| ID | Sev | Fix |
|:---|:---|:---|
| TL-01 | blocker | The AI Workspace status pill is **1.03:1** in dark (`#323130` on `#333333`) -- replace with a theme resource |
| TL-02 | blocker | The chat empty state is **1.07:1** in dark; the dividers and bubble fills vanish with it |
| TL-03 | major | `systemTextColor` returns black under the default `ThemeMode.system` -- resolve the *effective* brightness at all five call sites |
| TL-04 | major | The `stopped` pill fails AA in both themes (2.70:1 / 3.60:1) -- hardcoded `Colors.orange` |
| TL-05 | major | The amber BETA pill is **1.40:1** in light; move the colour to a token (it is also duplicated as a raw literal in the nav) |
| TL-06 | major | The AI Assistant FAB is **1.02:1** in dark -- only its border ring makes it findable |
| PS-14 | major | Same control in light (1.29:1); fix once |
| LN-24 | nit | Same control's hardcoded `Colors.grey` / `Colors.white` |
| PS-09 | major | The BETA/NEW badges measure 1.35:1 / 1.37:1 -- and amber means two different things |
| PS-20 | major | "stopped" (2.70:1) and "Starting up..." (3.84:1) both fail AA; stopped is the most-shown state |
| PS-21 | major | Disabled `FilledButton` labels are white on `#C6C6C6` (1.71:1), and two of three are always disabled |
| PS-36 | major | Chat empty-state hint at 3.69:1; remove the five `Colors.grey` literals in that file |
| ST-10 | major | The disabled-control explanation renders at 2.51:1 while the line above it is 6.00:1 |
| CI-34 | major | Selecting a snippet drops its contrast from 17.4:1 to 2.49:1 |
| TL-08 | nit | One shared set of surface/border greys -- currently six alphas across five files |
| TL-07 | nit | Delete `systemBackgroundColor`: 30 lines nothing consumes, carrying TL-03's bug |
| PS-24 | nit | The `notInstalled` dot is darker than running or stopped and reads as a bullet |
| ST-57 | nit | "(by you)" and "[v0.0.0]" at 4.41:1 and 3.96:1, both sub-AA |
| CI-03 | nit | Inline validation uses hardcoded `Colors.red` bold 12px, unlike every other error in the app |
| CI-40 | nit | The 20%-black chip is invisible in dark theme |
| ST-59 | nit | The code editor hardcodes `atomOneLightTheme`, so syntax colours ignore the app theme |

### FIX-11 -- Close the localization holes

Two blockers: one panel renders its own i18n keys, and a whole dialog is untranslated
in six of eight non-English locales. The CI gate that should have caught both only
checks that keys are *present*.

| ID | Sev | Fix |
|:---|:---|:---|
| TL-09 | blocker | Translate the 35-37 missing Mount Disk keys in `es`, `hu`, `ja`, `pt`, `tr`, `zh_TW` |
| PS-40 | blocker | Add the three `recommend-*` keys -- they are missing from **all nine** locales including `en`, so the panel prints its key names |
| TL-16 | major | Same three keys, recorded from the locale side; closes with PS-40 |
| TL-10 | major | Widen `locales_test.dart`'s gate from key-presence to the untranslated-value rule that already exists but is scoped to 60 keys; expect 131 locale-key pairs to fail and fix them |
| TL-12 | major | Translate the German nav pane's "Home" and "Mount Disk" |
| PS-43 | major | Build the "Go to Templates" label from one key with a placeholder, not three English fragments |
| CI-10 | major | Key the three hardcoded English strings in the "no results" panel |
| TL-11 | major | Fix the Turkish "örnek" collision -- ten strings mean *instance*, five legitimately mean *sample* |
| LN-14 | major | Move the hardcoded "Dark Mode" toggle label into `en.json` |
| PS-26 | nit | "Installed: cmd://openclaw" -- key it and stop leaking the internal URI sentinel |
| PS-29 | nit | Build the uninstall success toast from a key with a placeholder, not concatenation |
| IA-21 | nit | Same for the recommendation link built by an if/else on a route string |
| TL-13 | nit | Decide whether "AI Workspace" is a product name; if not, translate it (it is the only Latin script in the `ja` and `zh_TW` nav panes) |

### FIX-12 -- Copy, casing and terminology

| ID | Sev | Fix |
|:---|:---|:---|
| TL-17 | major | Pick sentence case (98 Title Case vs 91 sentence case short labels in `en.json`) and apply it across the locales that inherited the drift |
| LN-22 | major | Rewrite the empty-state copy: split the two unrelated states it merges and give a next step |
| ST-09 | major | Label the 26 `.wslconfig` settings in prose instead of the raw camelCase key |
| CI-27 | major | Rewrite the turnkey warning -- five italic lines containing `fake_systemd` and a shell pipeline |
| TL-15 | nit | Delete the 59 English keys nothing renders (19 of them an unshipped subscription flow), and their nine translations each |
| TL-18 | nit | One spelling of "(Optional)" -- currently three, including both on the same field |
| PS-25 | nit | One casing convention in the status badge column ("Not Installed" / "Starting up..." / "running") |
| LN-15 | nit | Nav pane labels to one case convention |
| CI-39 | nit | "install it with **the** following command" -- fix in all nine locales |
| CI-21 | nit | Merge `entername-text` and `errorentername-text` |
| ST-11 | nit | Stop repeating the description verbatim 20px below itself as the disabled reason |
| ST-12 | nit | Name the label, not the raw key, in the disabled reason |
| CI-26 | nit | Group the six source types and give each a description line instead of bare developer jargon |
| ST-56 | nit | One name for a snippet -- currently Snippets / snippet / "Name of setting" / quick action |

### FIX-13 -- Sell only what exists, gate it once

The purchase screen sells two features with no reachable implementation and never shows
a price. Separately, there are four gating components of which three have no call sites.

| ID | Sev | Fix |
|:---|:---|:---|
| PS-01 | blocker | Remove Script Generation and Smart Recommendations from the purchase table, or ship them (the L in this list) |
| PS-02 | blocker | Show the price on the purchase screen |
| PS-04 | major | Show the feature list to Pro users too -- it currently lives only in the non-Pro branch |
| PS-05 | major | Add a restore-purchase / support path for a wrong MSIX entitlement result |
| PS-08 | major | One gate component with one vocabulary; delete `ProBadge` / `ProFeatureWrapper` / `UpgradePrompt` or use them |
| PS-03 | major | Give the comparison glyphs text or semantics; the "not included" mark measures 1.85:1 |
| CI-23 | major | Offer a non-AI remedy first -- with no key, the only remedy answers with a go-to-Settings toast |
| LN-19 | nit | Do not show "Diagnose with AI" to users who cannot use it |
| PS-06 | nit | One name: the nav says "Upgrade to Pro", the page says "License" |
| PS-07 | nit | Drop the `canLaunchUrl` gate on the store button -- the codebase works around that bug everywhere else |
| PS-12 | nit | Per-field reason on the disabled BYOK fields, and placeholders that do not read as filled-in values |
| PS-13 | nit | Keep the BETA badge on the paywall that the Pro build shows on the same page |
| PS-39 | nit | Remove the chat panel's unreachable Upgrade button (the FAB that opens it is Pro-only) |

### FIX-14 -- AI Workspace card lifecycle

One shared `isBusy` flag drives every button on every card, so the spinner appears on
the wrong control in three of four cases.

| ID | Sev | Fix |
|:---|:---|:---|
| PS-15 | blocker | Per-action busy state: Start currently spins Uninstall, the dashboard spins Stop+Uninstall, and uninstall spins Start |
| PS-16 | major | Allow Stop on a tool stuck in "Starting up..." -- Uninstall is not an acceptable only option |
| PS-22 | major | Remove the permanently disabled "Installed" button that repeats the badge on the same row |
| PS-23 | major | On a running tool, Open Dashboard is the primary action, not Stop |

### FIX-15 -- Settings: validate `.wslconfig`, restore the missing controls

| ID | Sev | Fix |
|:---|:---|:---|
| ST-05 | blocker | Validate `.wslconfig` values before writing -- WSL rejects them on stderr with exit code 0, so the app currently reports nothing |
| ST-06 | major | Run the validation on change, not on an unrelated rebuild |
| ST-08 | major | Fix or replace `SysInfo` -- it reports 0 bytes and 1 core here, so the Memory / Processors / Swap sliders never render at all |
| ST-16 | major | Give enumerations a "not set" item so a value can be un-chosen, as the booleans allow |
| ST-20 | major | The public-internet warning currently shows whenever MCP is on, contradicting the hint two lines above it |
| ST-17 | nit | Position the enumeration flyout so it does not cover its own field, and mark the current value |
| ST-21 | nit | Give the copy buttons feedback |
| ST-23 | nit | Explain the sync group; remove the plaintext example password from a masked field; move the non-sync setting out |
| ST-24 | nit | Disable "Remote SSH target" while the toggle that uses it is off |
| ST-25 | nit | Distinguish a set path from an unset one -- both currently render as grey placeholder text |
| ST-26 | nit | Do not materialise a Docker repository default the user never chose on Save |
| ST-15 | nit | "true (Default)" and "Not set -- using the default" state one fact twice on one row, twelve times over |

### FIX-16 -- The create / install form

| ID | Sev | Fix |
|:---|:---|:---|
| CI-04 | major | Show the sanitised name, or reject the input -- silently rewriting `[^A-Za-z0-9]` to `_` turns an all-non-ASCII name into `___` |
| CI-05 | major | One sanitiser and one duplicate check shared by Create and Copy; Copy currently skips the duplicate check entirely |
| CI-01 | major | Clear the error banner when the input that caused it changes |
| CI-02 | major | One duplicate-name message, not two simultaneously in two visual styles |
| CI-08 | major | Reset the source value when Source Type changes |
| CI-35 | major | An empty search must say so, and only visibly-selected snippets may be downloaded |
| CI-38 | major | Make `wsl --install` a button that states it needs elevation, not a hyperlink described as text to copy |
| CI-06 | nit | Give the name field an `InfoLabel`, like the field below it |
| CI-07 | nit | Hide the clear (X) button when the field is empty |
| CI-09 | nit | Per-source-type tooltip text, positioned off the Source Type box |
| CI-11 | nit | Implement the empty `snapshot.hasError` branch, add a loading state, and hoist the future out of `build` |

### FIX-17 -- Home list and navigation layout

| ID | Sev | Fix |
|:---|:---|:---|
| LN-03 | major | Hoist the `GlobalKey` out of `build` -- a new key per build tears down the list subtree (and leaks `reloadEvery5Seconds`'s `for(;;)` loop) every time the AI panel toggles |
| LN-01 | major | Give the distro name the row width it has; `Expanded` + `Flexible` both at flex 1 split it 50/50 and leave ~480px empty |
| LN-02 | major | Reserve the running indicator's space so the name does not jump ~30px when a distro starts or stops |
| LN-10 | major | Keep the BETA badge off the AI Workspace icon in compact mode -- it hides the only affordance |
| PS-10 | major | Same overlap, recorded from the Pro pass; closes with LN-10 |
| LN-21 | major | Separate the empty-state CTA from the AI chat FAB -- they occupy the same corner |
| LN-05 | nit | Replace the one solid glyph among eight outlines |
| LN-06 | nit | Redraw the rename / disk-usage icons and differentiate save-template from copy |
| LN-08 | nit | One icon size within a row (header default vs action bar pinned to 16px) |
| LN-09 | nit | Hover the whole row, not the chevron 660px from the cursor |
| LN-11 | nit | Differentiate the Snippets and Templates nav icons at 16px |
| LN-07 | nit | Say what fills the expanded row when no snippets are configured |
| LN-16 | nit | `PaneItemAction` for Mount Disk and About -- they open modals, not destinations |
| LN-25 | nit | Label the size column and say it is VHDX-on-disk; do not blank silently on failure |
| LN-26 | nit | Start must not stay enabled, and must not still say "Start", on a running distro |

### FIX-18 -- Recommendations panel

The dismiss control writes to prefs and changes nothing, and the "clear" function adds
to the list it claims to clear.

| ID | Sev | Fix |
|:---|:---|:---|
| PS-41 | major | Dismiss must remove the card from the panel, not just write `DismissedRecommendations` |
| PS-42 | major | `clearDismissed()` must clear, and the "Go to" link must not dismiss as a side effect |
| PS-44 | nit | Hide the panel when every recommendation is dismissed instead of leaving an empty bordered box |
| PS-45 | nit | Pin the dismiss X to the right edge and raise the 11px / 10px text |

### FIX-19 -- AI chat panel

| ID | Sev | Fix |
|:---|:---|:---|
| PS-34 | major | Say up front that the panel needs an API key, and give it a close and a cancel |
| PS-37 | nit | Use a person glyph for the user avatar, not `FluentIcons.add` |
| PS-38 | nit | Make the 360px panel responsive below ~1000px, where it takes 40% of the window |

### FIX-20 -- Templates, snippets, mount and the per-distro dialog

Pure polish, but it is where a third of the audit's nits live. Safe to parallelise
across contributors -- four independent files.

| ID | Sev | Fix |
|:---|:---|:---|
| ST-37 | major | Format sub-GB template sizes properly and never silently drop a template from the list because it formats to "0 GB" |
| ST-39 | major | Title the new-instance dialog for what it does, not "Copy ... the WSL instance" |
| ST-55 | major | Size the snippet expander to its content instead of a 430px panel that is 97% empty |
| ST-42 | nit | Same size formatter ("0.01 GB") |
| ST-41 | nit | Give the templates screen a title, an explanation of what a template is, and a way to create one |
| ST-47 | nit | Replace the three radio buttons used as a tab strip, and change the title in unmount mode |
| ST-48 | nit | Say the list is empty rather than making the picker vanish |
| ST-49 | nit | Finish the mount-options placeholder sentence, or tooltip it |
| ST-50 | nit | Space the Partition / Filesystem Type labels |
| ST-52 | nit | Say which distro the disk lands in and where it appears |
| ST-58 | nit | Frame and label the code editor -- 580px of invisible click target |
| ST-60 | nit | Say that a snippet is a root bash script in a distro, and let it be run from this screen |
| ST-61 | nit | One "add" affordance; fix "Add Community snippets" |
| ST-31 | nit | Show which state "Start/Stop serving on network" is in, and persist `isSyncing` |
| ST-34 | nit | One visual language for "unset" -- the dialog's currently looks like a hyperlink |
| ST-35 | nit | Remove the duplicated user-section label and the orphaned parenthetical |
| IA-22 | nit | Hover must add contrast, not drop the row to 50% opacity |

## Not examined

Recorded as the audit runs, so it never implies coverage it does not have. This is the
union of the six per-area "not examined" sections; nothing is listed there that is not
listed here.

- **Remote WSL over SSH** -- needs a second Windows host; not available here. The *failure*
  path was exercised deliberately by pointing `RemoteWSLTarget` at an unreachable host
  (LN-17, LN-18, LN-20); the happy path was not. `copyDialog` branches on `UseRemoteWSL`
  (`copy_dialog.dart:73`, `:101`), so **copy over remote WSL** is unexamined for the same
  reason.
- **The zero-distro home empty state, live** -- reaching it means deleting the host's real
  distros, and `HomePage` constructs its own `WSLApi()` with no injection seam, so it
  cannot be substituted in a widget test either. LN-21 and LN-22 are recorded from source
  and labelled as such.
- **Docker container rows** (`showDocker`) and the `wslNotInstalled` install prompt -- no
  Docker containers on this host, and WSL is installed.
- **The row's quick-actions dropdown with snippets configured** -- none are configured, so
  only the empty branch was seen (LN-07).
- **The WSL-not-installed panel** (`install_dialog.dart`) -- WSL is installed on this host,
  so CI-38..CI-40 are read from source and labelled as such in [[create-and-install]].
- **A real Docker Hub pull, a real local `docker save`, and `Import VHDX`** -- no Docker
  daemon and no spare `.vhdx` here. Those three source types were exercised as far as the
  create *form* goes (CI-08, CI-10, CI-26); no image or disk was actually fetched.
- **The `passwd` console window** that the create flow spawns when a default user is given
  (CI-13) -- deliberately not triggered, so the audit does not leave a passwordless
  account on the host.
- **Windows in dark mode.** This host runs `AppsUseLightTheme = 1` and the OS theme was
  deliberately not flipped, so TL-03 -- the app handing black text to a dark UI under the
  default `ThemeMode.system` -- is measured from the getter by a probe test rather than
  screenshotted. The in-app Dark Mode toggle *was* exercised on eight screens.
- **Dark mode for the dialogs.** The light/dark pass covers the eight top-level screens.
  The distro-settings dialog, the mount dialog, the template and snippet dialogs and the
  *free-user* licence comparison table were not re-walked in dark; their `Colors.grey`
  sites are recorded from source in TL-08.
- **Locales beyond home / create / settings.** The three screens the task names were
  captured in all nine locales; the mount dialog was added in `zh_TW` because TL-09
  needed a picture. Templates, snippets, the AI Workspace and the licence screen were
  seen in English only.
- **Right-to-left languages** -- none are shipped, and nothing in the app opts into
  `Directionality`.
- **Store-packaged build** -- the audit runs an unpackaged debug build with the Pro gate
  forced. Anything whose appearance depends on real MSIX package identity (the Store
  purchase flow, a *false negative* from `GetCurrentPackageFullName`) is out of scope for
  the click-through. The **free-tier experience is covered**, though: [[pro-surfaces]]
  relaunched the same build *without* `WSLM_FORCE_PRO`, which is exactly the unpackaged
  free path, and audited every gate from there.
- **The AI Workspace page-level error state** (PS-31) -- `AiWorkspaceService` builds its
  own `ExecutionRequest`s and never sets `useRemote`, so the unreachable-SSH trick that
  reached the list's error branch does not touch it; the only other route is unregistering
  the host's real 16.6 GB `ai-workspace` distro. Read from source and labelled as such.
- **`AiDiagnoseButton` / `diagnoseWithAi()`** -- it only renders on a distro row already in
  an error state or on a failed create. An attempt to reach it via an unreachable
  `RemoteWSLTarget` was abandoned after the SSH connect had not timed out in 2.5 minutes;
  the resulting loading state is already recorded as LN-18/LN-20. Behaviour read from
  source in [[pro-surfaces]] and not counted as a finding.
- **A real AI chat exchange** -- needs a live OpenAI-compatible key and would send this
  machine's WSL configuration to a third-party endpoint. The markdown rendering of
  assistant replies, the scroll-to-bottom behaviour and the in-flight loading row were
  therefore not observed.
- **Dark mode for the Pro surfaces** -- deliberately deferred to [[theme-and-locales]],
  which owns the light/dark diff. PS-36 lists the hardcoded `Colors.grey` literals that
  pass should start from.
- **The Cloudflare tunnel path in MCP settings** -- enabling it downloads `cloudflared`
  and publishes this machine's MCP server, which can run arbitrary commands in every
  distro, to a public URL. Deliberately not triggered; ST-22 is read from source and
  labelled as such in [[settings-and-tools]].
- **A real disk mount** -- no spare physical disk or `.vhdx`, and `wsl --mount` of a disk
  Windows is using is not something to try on the audit machine. The mount forms, the
  empty-unmount state and the empty-field guard were exercised (ST-44..ST-52); no disk was
  attached. Of the four mount/unmount error-recovery dialogs (`mount_dialog.dart:110-251`),
  **the generic one at `:242` was reached** by [[interaction-and-a11y]] -- a VHD mount
  pointed at a missing path, which is what produced IA-16. The unmount-by-name (`:110-160`)
  and attached-but-not-mounted (`:184-230`) branches still need a genuinely attached disk
  and were not reached.
- **Sync over the network** (`Sync().startServer()`, `download()`) -- needs a second
  machine. ST-23, ST-30 and ST-31 are about the controls, not the transport.
- **`Move`, and `Templates().useTemplate()`** -- the confirmations were opened and
  cancelled (ST-29, ST-39, `122`); neither operation was run, so no distro was
  export/unregister/imported and no instance was created from a template.
- **The zero-template state and the sub-5MB template disappearance** -- one real template
  (`test-4`) exists here; ST-37 is read from source and `notemplates-text` was not reached.
- **Actual screen-reader output.** IA-09's "22 of 38 tap targets have no accessible name"
  and IA-10's "no `Semantics(label:)` anywhere" are counted from the widget tree and from
  the `MergeSemantics(Tooltip(...))` contract AGENTS.md documents. No Narrator or NVDA
  session was run, so the counts are claimed and the exact utterances are not.
- **Windows High Contrast mode, the "Show focus rectangle" setting, and non-100% display
  scaling.** IA-07's one-pixel focus ring was measured in the default theme at
  `devicePixelRatio` 1.0.
- **Stop-by-stop tab order beyond four surfaces.** Home, Add an Instance, Settings and the
  delete confirmation were walked keystroke by keystroke with the VM-Service focus probe;
  Snippets, Templates, Distro packages, AI Workspace, License and About were only checked
  for reachability from the nav pane. IA-02 and IA-03 live in the shell and were confirmed
  on two screens each.
- **Reverse (`Shift+Tab`) traversal order.** Only exercised from IA-01's dead root-scope
  state, where nothing moves. The forward order recorded in IA-05 was not verified to be
  symmetric.
- **Long-running operations on the Docker, remote-WSL and AI Workspace paths.** IA-12 was
  measured on start / stop / delete against a real distro; the Docker messages in IA-18 are
  read from source (no Docker daemon here), and the cancel gaps on the other two paths are
  recorded as CI-14 and PS-18 rather than re-walked.
- **The `loading: true` X pressed mid-operation.** IA-14 is derived from
  `notify.dart:63-67` and `root_screen.dart:231`; no multi-minute operation was started
  purely to click its close button.
- **A failed `AiWorkspaceService.stop()`** (PS-32) -- would mean deliberately breaking a
  tool inside the distro. Read from source; the fix is covered by a unit test that
  forces the failing exit code instead (`ai_workspace_service_test.dart`).
- **The MCP server's Pro half beyond the gate.** The endpoint, token, copy and regenerate
  controls were audited under the Pro build (ST-19..ST-22); [[pro-surfaces]] adds only the
  free-user gate (PS-11). The tunnel stays untriggered for the reason above.
- **Locales at the narrow 900px width.** Below fluent_ui's 1008px threshold the pane is
  icon-only, so the labels that could overflow are not rendered there at all; the narrow
  pass covers the layout itself, not the translated labels in it.
- **The recommendations panel in dark.** Reaching it needs `DockerImageCount` seeded as
  [[pro-surfaces]] did; its border (`recommendations_panel.dart:29`) is in TL-08 from
  source.
