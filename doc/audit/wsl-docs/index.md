# WSL documentation audit

A diff of the official Microsoft WSL documentation against what WSL Distro Manager
actually exposes. Every finding cites **`microsoftdocs/wsl@8842def (2026-07-30)`** (full
SHA `8842def77a852af26318b9ebec78063a94b068ed`, branch `main`) so it stays falsifiable
when the docs move.

## The four areas

| Area | Scope | Documented | Exposed | Missing | Re-verified |
|:---|:---|---:|---:|---:|:---|
| [[wslconfig-keys]] | global `%UserProfile%\.wslconfig` | 27 reference-table keys | **27** | 0 | 3 verdicts corrected |
| [[wslconf-keys]] | per-distro `/etc/wsl.conf` | 15 keys / 7 sections | 11 | **4** | confirmed as written |
| [[cli-flags]] | `wsl.exe` commands and options | 30 top-level verbs (64 incl. options) | 13 | 17 | confirmed; one grep footnoted |
| [[features]] | whole capability surfaces | 11 assessed | 0 fully | **7** (+4 partial) | F-5 amended |

Sweep totals from [[coverage-sweep]], which enumerated the app side rather than the docs
side: **27 / 27** `.wslconfig` keys, **11 / 11** `wsl.conf` keys and **27 / 27** `wsl.exe`
invocation sites in `lib/api/wsl.dart` resolve to a row above. Nothing the app renders or
invokes is missing a verdict.

> [!NOTE]
> The four columns above record the app **as measured on 2026-08-28, before Phase 05**, and
> are deliberately left at those numbers so the diff stays falsifiable against
> `microsoftdocs/wsl@8842def`. What changed since is carried by the **Landed** column in
> each *Finding registry* table and summarised in *Phase 05 implementation record*. In
> short: `wsl.conf` is now **15 / 15** and every `.wslconfig` key is on its documented
> widget type.

[[runtime]] is the third pass: it executes WSL **2.6.3.0** and measures what the installed
build actually does, so the version floors, the section-placement arguments and the
"changes need a restart" claims stop being inferences. It withdraws one claim, escalates
three findings to data-affecting, and adds four new ones — the largest being that the app
writes Windows paths into `.wslconfig` with single backslashes, which WSL discards as a
parse error ([[runtime]] R-6).

[[coverage-sweep]] is the fourth and last pass, and it runs in the opposite direction to
the other three: it enumerates the app — every key the two editors render, every `wsl.exe`
invocation in `lib/api/wsl.dart` — and looks each one up in the tables, so the audit's
*silences* are checked rather than its claims. **The key and flag inventories held**: 27 / 27
`.wslconfig` keys, 11 / 11 `wsl.conf` keys and 27 / 27 invocation sites already had a
verdict. It adds four findings at the edges of those tables and **withdraws one**.

[[verification]] is the second pass over all four: every missing key re-grepped, every
widget type checked against the documented value type, every tooltip diffed string-for-string
against the doc sentence. No claim was withdrawn; 3 verdicts were corrected and 8 findings
added, the largest of which is a slider that **throws on a documented-legal `.wslconfig`
value** ([[wslconfig-keys]] CC-9).

## What the audit actually found

The headline is not what the brief anticipated. **`.wslconfig` key coverage is complete** —
all 20 `[wsl2]` and all 7 `[experimental]` keys are rendered, verified by grepping both
the camelCase and the all-lowercase spelling of each (`.wslconfig` matching is
case-insensitive, and the docs' own example file uses lowercase). There is no
missing-key finding in that area at all.

The real gaps are elsewhere, and they fall into four groups — plus one outright crash the
[[verification]] pass found while checking widget types, which outranks all of them:
`memory=8589934592` is the documented byte-form of 8 GB, and feeding it to the app's
`memory` slider trips `fluent_ui`'s range assert and throws the Settings page
([[wslconfig-keys]] CC-9).

1. **Presentation.** Two enums, two size keys and two numeric keys rendered as untyped
   free text; two path keys with no file picker; seven `.wslconfig` toggles and six
   `wsl.conf` toggles that display `false` for keys documented as defaulting to `true`;
   five documented "only applicable when…" dependencies that no widget honours; and a
   `wsl.conf` dialog with no descriptions and no localisation at all.
2. **Two config writers with real defects.** `.wslconfig` (`wsl.dart:544-592`) is
   section-blind, case-sensitive against a case-insensitive format, and strips every space
   inside a value. `wsl.conf` (`assets/scripts/settings.bash`) is section-blind in a way
   that makes `[automount] enabled` and `[interop] enabled` overwrite each other, and
   breaks outright on any value containing `/` — including `automount.root`'s documented
   default `/mnt/`.
3. **No version awareness.** Neither `wsl --version` nor `wsl --status` is called anywhere
   in `lib/`, so not one of the version floors this audit records can be enforced.
4. **Whole verbs and surfaces absent.** `wsl --manage` in its entirety (resize, move,
   set-sparse, set-default-user), `--export --format`, `--import-in-place`,
   `--set-default`, `--set-version`, custom-distro `.wsl` distribution, disk-space
   management.

## Reading order

- **[[wslconfig-keys]]** — per-key table for `[wsl2]` and `[experimental]`, plus eleven
  cross-cutting findings (CC-1 … CC-11) about the editor and the `.wslconfig` parser/writer.
- **[[wslconf-keys]]** — per-key table for all seven `wsl.conf` sections, plus seven
  cross-cutting findings, two of them data-affecting.
- **[[cli-flags]]** — every documented (**D**) and `--help`-only (**H**) `wsl.exe` command
  against every invocation in `lib/`.
- **[[features]]** — eleven whole capabilities, including the ones that are "covered" at
  key level and still unusable.
- **[[verification]]** — the second pass. Read this before quoting any verdict from the four
  files above; it is where three of them changed, and it carries the full tooltip diff
  (10 covered / 16 outdated / 1 wrong) that the per-key tables only summarise.
- **[[runtime]]** — the third pass, against WSL 2.6.3.0 on this machine. Read this before
  citing any version floor, any "WSL ignores that" claim, or any restart requirement; its
  *Corrections* table lists every earlier finding it changed.
- **[[coverage-sweep]]** — the false-negative pass. Read this if you are about to claim
  the audit is complete, or if you are implementing P05-02, P05-04 or P05-05, whose scope
  it changed.
- **This file, from *Sizing rubric* on** — the classification pass. Every finding above,
  sized and ranked, mapped to the issues that report it, and flattened into the
  *Ordered implementation list for Phase 05*. If you are implementing rather than reading,
  start there and use the area files as reference.
- **This file, *Phase 05 implementation record*** — what actually shipped, written
  2026-08-28 against the code on `beta`. Read it before starting work on any finding
  above: 16 of the 24 items are done, 3 are partial and 5 are deferred, and every table
  in the *Finding registry* now carries a **Landed** column pointing at the file and line.

Supporting material, outside the repo tree, under
`.maestro/playbooks/2026-08-28-WSL-Manager-Backlog-Audit/Working/`:
`wsl-docs-source.md` (provenance, page inventory, `ms.date` stamps),
`wslconfig-keys.md`, `wslconf-keys.md`, `wsl-exe-flags.md` (the documented-side
inventories these four files diff against), and `runtime/` (the ten probe `.wslconfig`
files behind [[runtime]], the backup of this machine's original file, and the scripts that
applied [[runtime]]'s corrections back into the four area files).

## Verdict vocabulary

| Verdict | Meaning |
|:---|:---|
| `covered` | Present and correctly presented. |
| `outdated` | Present, but the wording or presentation reflects an older doc state, or omits a condition the docs state. |
| `wrong` | Present, but the app's behaviour contradicts the documentation. |
| `missing` | Not present at all. |

## Sizing rubric

Sizes are about **implementation cost in this codebase**, not about how much the finding
matters. Ranking carries the impact; size carries the effort.

| Size | Means | Typical shape |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **S** | A change inside an existing editor or call site: a key, a widget type, a label, a tooltip, its i18n keys, a flag added to an existing `wsl.exe` invocation. No new file, no new screen, no new architecture. | a `settings_screen.dart` key row · a `wsl.conf` key · one `--flag` |
| **M** | A new section, dialog or service, **or** a rewrite of an existing read/write path that needs its own tests. | the `.wslconfig` engine · the `wsl.conf` writer · a WSL capability service · a disk-space panel |
| **L** | A new screen or subsystem, with its own state, files on disk and lifecycle. | custom-distro `.wsl` packaging |

The Phase 04 brief's rubric says S = "a key added to an existing editor", M = "a new
section or dialog", L = "a new screen or subsystem". Two of this audit's most severe
findings are none of those — they are rewrites of existing writers. They are sized **M**
under the extended rule above, and each says so on its own row, so nobody reads "M" as
"new dialog" and goes looking for one.

## Ranking rubric

Impact tiers, highest first. Within a tier, an item with a reported issue behind it
outranks one without.

| Tier | Criterion |
|:---|:---|
| **0** | Destroys or silently discards user data or configuration, or crashes. |
| **1** | The app displays state that is not true, or writes a value that never takes effect — the user believes something false. |
| **2** | A documented behaviour or condition exists and the app cannot express or enforce it. |
| **3** | A documented capability is absent and users have asked for it. |
| **4** | Absent capability with no reported demand; cosmetic; hygiene. |

## Evidence — findings mapped to reported issues

The area files were written from the docs and the code alone, so every severity claim in
them is judgement. This section supplies the missing half: the
`bostrot/wsl2-distro-manager` issue tracker (183 issues, open and closed, read
2026-08-28) matched against the findings.

**Direct** = the issue describes the exact mechanism a finding predicts. **Plausible** =
the symptom matches but the report carries no repro or environment. **Adjacent** = same
area, different mechanism — recorded so Phase 05 does not overclaim.

| Issue | State | What was reported | Finding | Strength |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| [#280](https://github.com/bostrot/wsl2-distro-manager/issues/280) | closed | "Move" ran with no prompt, then the distro was gone | [[cli-flags]] CC-2 — `move()` is export → unregister → import | **direct** — the destructive middle step is exactly what `--manage --move` avoids |
| [#185](https://github.com/bostrot/wsl2-distro-manager/issues/185) | closed | hostname set from the app never reaches `/etc/wsl.conf`; a manual `echo -e >> /etc/wsl.conf` works | [[wslconf-keys]] CC-1 / CC-2 | **direct** — the user's own workaround is the writer's third branch, the only one that is not `sed` |
| [#309](https://github.com/bostrot/wsl2-distro-manager/issues/309) | **open** | setting a default user at creation replaced `wsl.conf`, losing `[boot] systemd=true` | [[wslconf-keys]] CC-1 | **direct** — the create path was since changed to `setSetting` (`create_dialog.dart:324`, commit `4913741`, 2026-06-16), but the issue is still open and the writer beneath it is still section-blind |
| [#261](https://github.com/bostrot/wsl2-distro-manager/issues/261) | closed | "the actual status of Systemd is the opposite of the setting item display" | [[wslconf-keys]] CC-3 | **direct** — a documented-`true` key rendered from `?? false` |
| [#225](https://github.com/bostrot/wsl2-distro-manager/issues/225) · [#234](https://github.com/bostrot/wsl2-distro-manager/issues/234) | closed | the app offered `pageReporting`; WSL then warned `Unknown key 'wsl2.pageReporting'` on every start | [[wslconfig-keys]] CC-8 (the orphan string is what remains of it) and CC-3 | **direct** — and the one time a user has reported reading WSL's stderr, which is where [[runtime]] R-4's silent rejections also land |
| [#87](https://github.com/bostrot/wsl2-distro-manager/issues/87) | closed | Save overrides hand-written `.wslconfig` settings | [[wslconfig-keys]] CC-3 | **direct** — the re-emit-everything-into-`[wsl2]` path |
| [#224](https://github.com/bostrot/wsl2-distro-manager/issues/224) | closed | "I have no idea what format to define the amount of swap space in" | the `swap` row (size key, no size widget) + the tooltip diff | **direct** — closed by adding the `(e.g. 8GB, 512MB)` examples; the widget was never fixed |
| [#268](https://github.com/bostrot/wsl2-distro-manager/issues/268) | **open** | typing `wsl` lands in root at `/mnt/c/Users/…` after creating a distro with this app | [[wslconf-keys]] CC-6 (`[user] default` not editable) + `--set-default` | **direct** |
| [#313](https://github.com/bostrot/wsl2-distro-manager/issues/313) | **open** | delete a distro, recreate it under the same name, it still starts as the deleted user | [[wslconf-keys]] CC-6 — the `[user] default` / `StartUser_` prefs lifecycle | **direct**, but **the mechanism is already fixed** — [[coverage-sweep]] Sweep 4: `clearDistroPrefs` (`helpers.dart:388`) runs from `WSLApi.remove` (`wsl.dart:951`). The issue is open against a version that predates it; verify before rebuilding |
| [#192](https://github.com/bostrot/wsl2-distro-manager/issues/192) | closed | default user lost after shrink/cleanup | same | **direct** |
| [#303](https://github.com/bostrot/wsl2-distro-manager/issues/303) | **open** | Compact fills the drive; no free-space pre-check | [[features]] F-11 | **direct** |
| [#133](https://github.com/bostrot/wsl2-distro-manager/issues/133) | closed | "Disk shrinking" | F-3 (reclaim half) + F-11 | **direct** |
| [#103](https://github.com/bostrot/wsl2-distro-manager/issues/103) | **open** | set the WSL version per distro and the default version | [[cli-flags]] `--set-version` / `--set-default-version` | **direct** |
| [#300](https://github.com/bostrot/wsl2-distro-manager/issues/300) | closed | "点击设置闪退" — the app exits the moment Settings is clicked (v1.10.0, no environment given) | [[wslconfig-keys]] CC-9 | **plausible** — the symptom is exactly CC-9's, but the report has no `.wslconfig` and no repro. A candidate, not proof; reproducing CC-9 would retro-explain it |
| [#203](https://github.com/bostrot/wsl2-distro-manager/issues/203) | **open** | export / import feature requests | [[cli-flags]] CC-3 (`--export --format`) | adjacent |
| [#239](https://github.com/bostrot/wsl2-distro-manager/issues/239) · [#279](https://github.com/bostrot/wsl2-distro-manager/issues/279) · [#15](https://github.com/bostrot/wsl2-distro-manager/issues/15) | **open** ×2 | add the distro to the Windows Terminal menu; launch through its dynamic profile | F-8 — `wsl-distribution.conf`'s `[windowsterminal]` and `[shortcut]` are the documented mechanism for exactly this | **direct for F-8's motivation**, though an `--import`-created distro's missing profile has other causes too |
| [#14](https://github.com/bostrot/wsl2-distro-manager/issues/14) · [#59](https://github.com/bostrot/wsl2-distro-manager/issues/59) | closed | bridged networking; per-distro IPs | F-1 `networkingMode` | adjacent — both predate `mirrored` |
| [#310](https://github.com/bostrot/wsl2-distro-manager/issues/310) | **open** | a screen reader finds unlabelled controls | [[wslconf-keys]] CC-4 (no labels, no descriptions, no i18n) | adjacent — the report is about the distro action bar, not this dialog, but CC-4 is the same defect class and the dialog would fail the same test |
| [#159](https://github.com/bostrot/wsl2-distro-manager/issues/159) | closed | "Load settings for existing distros" | `loadDistroSettings` exists because of this; V-7's spelling risk lives in it | context |

Nine of those twenty are still open. **Every tier-0 and tier-1 item below has at least one
reported issue behind it** — the audit's severity judgements survive contact with the
issue tracker, which is the open question [[verification]] and [[features]] both flagged
in their "what was not examined" sections.

## Finding registry — every finding, sized

Every finding in the seven files, with its size and the item that closes it. Nothing is left
without a destination: items are **P05-01 … P05-24**, and findings with no item appear in
*Not scheduled* below with a reason.

### [[wslconfig-keys]] — `.wslconfig`

| Finding | Verdict | Size | Item | Landed |
|:---|:---|:---:|:---|:---|
| CC-9 slider asserts on `memory=8589934592` / `processors=64` (V-1, R-9) | wrong | S | **P05-01** | ✅ `settings_screen.dart:1576` — `_numericSetting` calls `wslSliderFits` (`components/wsl_size.dart:80`) *before* the `Slider` constructor; anything out of range renders as an editable text box |
| `memory=6144MB` silently collapses to `1GB` (R-10) | wrong | S | **P05-01** | ✅ `components/wsl_size.dart:44` `parseWslSize`, unit-aware; 17 tests in `test/wsl_size_test.dart` |
| CC-2 `readConfig` strips every space inside a value | wrong | M | **P05-02** | ✅ new `api/ini_config.dart` model behind `wsl.dart:671` `readWslConfig` |
| CC-3 section-blind read and write; a key relocated to `[wsl2]` is rejected by WSL (R-4) | wrong | M | **P05-02** | ✅ `api/wslconfig.dart:206` `WslConfigFile.sectionFor`; the writers at `wsl.dart:728` and `:731` name the section |
| CC-4 case-sensitive matching against a case-insensitive format; the appended line loses (V-5, R-8) | wrong | M | **P05-02** | ✅ `api/ini_config.dart` — case-insensitive lookup, the file's own spelling preserved on write |
| CC-5 comment lines parsed as keys; `#` only, never `;` (R-7) | wrong | M | **P05-02** | ✅ `api/ini_config.dart`; the `#`-only dialect is set by `api/wslconfig.dart:155` `kWslConfigSchema` |
| CC-10 path values written with single backslashes; WSL discards the line (R-6) | wrong | M | **P05-02** | ✅ `api/wslconfig.dart:120` `escapeWslConfigPath`, over the three documented `path` keys listed at `:86` |
| `kernelCommandLine` mangled by CC-2 | wrong | M | **P05-02** | ✅ same engine — spaces inside a value survive the round trip |
| CC-11 a key can be added and changed but never removed; blocks the tri-state (S-2) | wrong | M | **P05-02** | ✅ `wsl.dart:731` `removeConfig`; the undo affordance is `settings_screen.dart:1472` `_tristateToggle` |
| CC-5 write half — unanchored regex, a commented-out key absorbs the write (S-3) | wrong | M | **P05-02** | ✅ `api/ini_config.dart` — a commented-out key parses as a comment, never as a match |
| CC-1 seven documented-`true` toggles render off when unset | wrong | S | **P05-04** | ✅ `settings_screen.dart:1472` `_tristateToggle` reading `api/wslconfig.dart:98` `kWslConfigBoolDefaults` |
| CC-7 restart requirement stated but hedged; Save never offers it (R-11) | covered | S | **P05-07** | ◐ **half.** The string is fixed — `i18n/en.json:117` states the restart unconditionally, in all nine locales. The **Save prompt is deferred**: `saveSettings` (`settings_screen.dart:251`) does not offer it, and `restartwslnow-text` / `restartwslprompt-text` (`en.json:410`) are translated but unreferenced |
| `networkingMode`, `autoMemoryReclaim` rendered as free text | wrong | S | **P05-09** | ✅ `settings_screen.dart:1527` `_enumerationBox`; the two rows at `:1150` and `:1317` |
| CC-6 five documented conditional dependencies honoured nowhere | missing | S | **P05-10** | ✅ `settings_screen.dart:1096`, `:1146`, `:1330`–`:1361`, reading `_configBool:1282` and `_networkingMode:1289` |
| `swap`, `defaultVhdSize` — size keys in plain text boxes | outdated | S | **P05-11** | ✅ `settings_screen.dart:1107` (size slider, `0` disables) and `:1175` (validated size box) |
| `vmIdleTimeout`, `maxCrashDumpCount` — numeric keys, no validation, no unit | outdated | S | **P05-11** | ✅ `settings_screen.dart:1132`, `:1138` — `SettingsType.number` (`:27`), unit in the label, documented default as placeholder |
| `kernel`, `swapFile` — path keys with no file picker | outdated | S | **P05-11** | ✅ `settings_screen.dart:1071`, `:1118` through `_filePickerSuffix:1297`, which `kernelModules` now shares |
| `guiApplications`' tooltip invents a Windows 11 restriction (V-3) | wrong | S | **P05-12** | ✅ `i18n/en.json:125` `guiinfo-text` — the invented restriction is gone, in all nine locales |
| `safeMode`'s tooltip is truncated, dropping the only WSL-version floor in the table (V-4) | outdated | S | **P05-12** | ✅ `i18n/en.json:226` `safemodeinfo-text` — the Win 11 / WSL 0.66.2+ floor is restored |
| 14 further incomplete tooltips; `processors` drops "logical"; two English defects in `globalconfigurationinfo-text` | outdated | S | **P05-12** | ✅ 26 strings rewritten in all nine locales; `processorinfo-text` at `en.json:120`, `globalconfigurationinfo-text` at `:117` |
| CC-8 orphaned `unusedmemoryinfo-text` (`pageReporting`) in nine locales | outdated | S | **P05-12** | ✅ deleted from all nine — `grep -rn unusedmemoryinfo-text lib/` returns nothing |
| R-1 `nestedVirtualization` is refused by the host CPU, and WSL says so on stderr | new | M | **P05-08** | ✅ `api/wsl_capabilities.dart:87` `WslCapabilities.warnings`, rendered at `settings_screen.dart:1232` |
| `systemDistro`, `kernelDebugPort` (Intune-only) absent | missing | — | not scheduled | ⊘ unchanged, deliberately — reason in *Not scheduled* |
| S-4 `Default Distro Location` / `General Data Location` share the `_settings` namespace | n/a | — | not scheduled | ⊘ unchanged, deliberately — an app preference, not a WSL key |

### [[wslconf-keys]] — `wsl.conf`

| Finding | Verdict | Size | Item | Landed |
|:---|:---|:---:|:---|:---|
| CC-1 section-blind `sed`; `[automount] enabled` and `[interop] enabled` overwrite each other | wrong | M | **P05-03** | ✅ `api/wsl_conf.dart:66` `WslConfFile` over `api/ini_config.dart`; `wsl.dart:2097` `readWSLConf` / `:2147` `updateWSLConf`. `assets/scripts/settings.bash` is **deleted** |
| CC-2 any value containing `/` breaks the `sed`, silently — including `automount.root`'s documented default | wrong | M | **P05-03** | ✅ same fix — no `sed` survives; the whole file is rewritten from the model |
| CC-7 free-text values interpolated unescaped into a **root** shell (V-6) | wrong | M | **P05-03** | ✅ `wsl.dart:2025` `writeDistroFile` base64-encodes the payload; the destination path is guarded by `wsl_args.dart` `isPlainDistroPath` |
| V-7 prefs keyed on the file's spelling, not the widget's | risk | M | **P05-03** | ✅ case-insensitive canonicalisation on read; `loadDistroSettings` (`settings_dialog.dart:666`) derives its key list from `wslConfSettings` (`:369`) instead of a hardcoded twelve |
| `boot.command`, `automount.root` unusable in practice | wrong | M | **P05-03** | ✅ both round-trip verbatim — `test/wsl_conf_test.dart`, and live against WSL 2.6.3 |
| CC-3 six documented-`true` toggles render off | wrong | S | **P05-04** | ✅ `settings_dialog.dart:334` `WslConfSetting.defaultOn`, read at `:563`; undo physically removes the line |
| CC-6 `[user] default` written at creation, never editable — and shadowed by the dialog's **Start user** box (S-1) | missing | S | **P05-05** | ✅ `settings_dialog.dart:413` — a real editor placed under the Start user box, which gained `startuserinfo-text` (`:150`). The `--set-default-user` half is partial; see [[cli-flags]] below |
| CC-5 every keystroke writes; no restart signal; `--terminate` suffices (R-12) | missing | S | **P05-06** | ✅ `components/debounced_text_box.dart` used at `settings_dialog.dart:655`; the restart rule at `:449`, **Terminate distro** at `:474` |
| CC-4 no labels, no descriptions, no `.i18n()` anywhere in the dialog | missing | S | **P05-13** | ✅ `settings_dialog.dart:369` — every key carries a localised label + description pair; nothing is derived from a Dart identifier |
| `automount.options` — a 7-token composite in a raw text box; the `metadata` precondition unstated | outdated | S | **P05-13** | ✅ `automountoptionsinfo-text` names all seven tokens and states the `metadata` precondition. The per-token editor stays deferred (*Not scheduled*) |
| `[boot] protectBinfmt`, `[gpu] enabled`, `[time] useWindowsTimezone` absent | missing | S | **P05-14** | ✅ `settings_dialog.dart:376`, `:405`, `:407`; the two new section headers at `:434`–`:435`. All fifteen documented keys are editable |

### [[cli-flags]] — `wsl.exe`

| Finding | Verdict | Size | Item | Landed |
|:---|:---|:---:|:---|:---|
| CC-1 `--version` / `--status` never invoked; no version gating possible | missing | M | **P05-08** | ✅ `api/wsl_capabilities.dart:229` `WslCapabilityService.load` — one cached call of each, parsed by shape because the output is localised |
| CC-2 `--manage --move` | missing | M | **P05-15** | ✅ `wsl.dart:2297` `moveDistro`, preferred by `move()` at `:1790` on WSL 2.5+; the export → unregister → import path survives only as the pre-2.5 fallback, and a failed native move is never retried down it |
| CC-2 `--manage --resize`, `--manage --set-sparse`, and `--system` | missing | M | **P05-16** | ✅ `wsl.dart:2305`, `:2313`, and `diskUsage` at `:2385` (`wsl --system … df -k`); the surface is `dialogs/disk_dialog.dart` |
| CC-2 `--manage --set-default-user` | missing | S | **P05-05** | ◐ **API only.** `wsl.dart:2321` `setDefaultUser` exists and is tested, but **has no caller** — the dialog writes `[user] default` instead (`settings_dialog.dart:413`), which is the documented mechanism and the only one that works for an imported distro. Preferring the verb on WSL 2.5+ is the remaining half |
| CC-3 every export is an uncompressed tar; `--format` unused | missing | S | **P05-17** | ◐ **API only.** `wsl.dart:1009`–`:1022` takes `format:` and packaging passes `tar.gz`; the export and template UI still never offer it |
| `--import-in-place` — `copyVhd()` copies the VHD twice | missing | S | **P05-18** | ⏸ **deferred, not started** — no `--import-in-place` anywhere in `lib/`; `copyVhd()` still copies twice |
| `--set-default`, `--set-version`, `--set-default-version` | missing | S | **P05-19** | ⏸ **deferred, not started** — the i18n keys are seeded (`en.json:448`–`:449`) but no call site exists |
| `--list --verbose` — state and version in one call | missing | S | **P05-20** | ⏸ **deferred, not started** — `wsl.dart:1682` still issues `--list --running --quiet` alongside the plain list |
| CC-5 dead `install()` carrying the `-d` ≠ `--name` trap | wrong | S | **P05-21** | ⏸ **deferred** — `wsl.dart:1088` `install()` is still present and still unreferenced. The correct form now sits next to it as `installFromFile` (`:2348`), which does use `--name` |
| CC-4 two hand-built `--mount` argument strings, one through an elevation path | risk | S | **P05-21** | ⏸ **deferred** — `mount_service.dart:248` still builds the argument string by hand and `:313` still pre-quotes the path |
| `--update`, `--update --web-download` | missing | M | **P05-23** | ✅ `wsl.dart:2327` `updateWsl`, driven from `settings_screen.dart:1253` next to the version display |
| `--shell-type`, `--distribution-id`, `--shutdown --force`, `--uninstall`, `--debug-shell`, `--list --online`, `--list --all`, `--import --version` | missing / n/a | — | not scheduled | ⊘ unchanged, deliberately — reasons in *Not scheduled* |

### [[features]] — capability surfaces

| Finding | Verdict | Size | Item | Landed |
|:---|:---|:---:|:---|:---|
| F-1 mirrored networking — key present, unexplained, ungated | outdated | S | **P05-09** + **P05-10** | ✅ `settings_screen.dart:1150` (combo box), `:1096` and `:1352`–`:1361` (the three dependencies `mirrored` changes) |
| F-2 DNS tunnelling — dependants ungated, tooltips thin | outdated | S | **P05-10** + **P05-12** | ✅ `settings_screen.dart:1330`–`:1338`; the tooltips are rewritten in all nine locales |
| F-3 sparse VHD — only the "newly created" half exists | missing | M | **P05-16** | ✅ `wsl.dart:2313` `--set-sparse` for existing distros, surfaced at `dialogs/disk_dialog.dart:179` with a description that says in so many words that it is not `[experimental] sparseVhd` |
| F-4 `wsl --manage` | missing | M | **P05-15**, **P05-16**, **P05-05** | ◐ three of four options shipped (`--move`, `--resize`, `--set-sparse`); `--set-default-user` is API-only — see [[cli-flags]] above |
| F-5 "WSL Settings" — Microsoft ships one; this app already uses the name for something else (V-8) | missing | S | **P05-22** + research item **R-A** | ⏸ **deferred** — `wslsettings-text` still names this app's dialog (`settings_dialog.dart:443`), and `microsoftwslsettings-text` (`en.json:450`) is translated in nine locales but never rendered. R-A was not run either |
| F-6 systemd — no distro-default awareness, no restart prompt, broken writer | outdated | M | **P05-03** + **P05-04** + **P05-06** | ✅ writer replaced (P05-03); `[boot] systemd` deliberately carries no `defaultOn` because it is whatever the image ships (`settings_dialog.dart:369`); the per-distro restart prompt is `:449` / `:474` |
| F-7 WSL plugins | missing | L | not scheduled | ⊘ unchanged, deliberately — no demand in 183 issues |
| F-8 custom-distro distribution (`.wsl`, `wsl-distribution.conf`) | missing | L | **P05-24** | ✅ `api/wsl_distribution_conf.dart`, `api/distro_package.dart`, `screens/package_screen.dart` (route `/package`, `nav/router.dart:86`), `wsl.dart:2348` `installFromFile`, gated on WSL 2.4.4 via `wsl_capabilities.dart:155` |
| F-9 WSL version awareness | missing | M | **P05-08** | ✅ `api/wsl_capabilities.dart`; the version, WSL's own warnings and the update buttons render at the top of Global Settings (`settings_screen.dart:1194`–`:1253`) |
| F-10 the 8-second rule, surfaced for one file of two | outdated | S | **P05-06** + **P05-07** | ◐ the per-distro half shipped (`settings_dialog.dart:449`, `:474`); the global half is P05-07's Save prompt, deferred |
| F-11 disk-space management | missing | M | **P05-16** | ✅ `dialogs/disk_dialog.dart` — allocated against used/free, resize, reclaim. #303's free-space pre-check on Compact already existed (`wsl.dart:1612`, over `freeSpaceBytes` at `:1499`) and was left as is |

[[verification]] V-1…V-8 and [[runtime]] R-1…R-13 are corrections and evidence attached to
the findings above, not separate work: each appears in these tables through the finding it
changed. V-2 — the `ComboBox` pattern already exists three times in this codebase — is the
reason P05-09 is **S** rather than **M**.

## Ordered implementation list for Phase 05

**This list was the input to Phase 05.** It is linear and complete: work it top to bottom.
Sizes total **17 S · 6 M · 1 L**.

**Outcome, 2026-08-28.** Phase 05 shipped **16 items** end to end, left **3 partial** and
**deferred 5**. Every **M** and the single **L** landed; the eight items that did not land
in full are all **S** and all tier 3–4. The *Status* column below carries each one, and
*Phase 05 implementation record* carries the reasons.

Order is impact-first, subject to dependencies. Two placements look like ranking errors
and are not:

- **P05-02 and P05-03 come before almost every key-level item.** Adding a key or a combo
  box to an editor whose writer corrupts what it writes only ships a nicer way to lose
  data.
- **P05-08, the enabling item, sits at position 8, not first.** Nothing in tiers 0–1 needs
  a version check; everything from P05-15 on does.

† **P05-15 is tier 0 by impact** — it is the only finding in this audit with a user report
of actual data loss (#280) — but it depends on P05-08, so it is scheduled after it. If
Phase 05 runs out of budget before position 15, promote it: an interim **S**-sized guard
(a confirmation dialog naming the export path, which is what #280 itself asked for) is
worth more than items 9–14 combined and needs nothing from P05-08.

### Item detail

**P05-01 — Clamp and unit-parse the size / number sliders · S · tier 0**
`settings_screen.dart:1194-1240`. Extract a size parser — bare `8589934592` is bytes,
`6144MB` and `8GB` carry units, a bare small number keeps the app's current GB convention
— and clamp into `[sizeMin, sizeMax]` before the `Slider` constructor sees the value. An
out-of-range value must render as an editable number with a warning, never as a clamped
lie.
*Done when:* a debug build opens Settings against `.wslconfig` files containing
`memory=8589934592`, `memory=6144MB` and `processors=64` without throwing, and Save
round-trips each unchanged; unit tests cover the parser.
*Do the reproduction before the fix.* It is the one step [[verification]] and [[runtime]]
both left undone — a one-line file edit and an app launch — and it decides whether #300
was this bug.

**P05-02 — Replace the `.wslconfig` read/write engine · M · tier 0**
`wsl.dart:534-646`, `settings_screen.dart:78-81, 271-317`. A sectioned, case-insensitive
model — the shape `getWSLConf` (`wsl.dart:1824`) already has for `wsl.conf` — preserving
comments, blank lines, and unknown keys **in their own sections**; values escaped on write
and unescaped on read (`\` → `\\`); no space stripping; `#` comments only, never `;`
(R-7). `saveSettings` must write each key back to the section it came from instead of
consulting a hardcoded seven-key list.
*Done when:* a `.wslconfig` carrying lowercase keys, comments, a hand-added
`[experimental]` key and a spaced `kernelCommandLine` survives load → Save byte-identical
apart from the key the user edited, and `wsl --shutdown && wsl -d <distro> true` prints no
diagnostic — [[runtime]]'s oracle, which makes this an exact and cheap regression test.

**P05-03 — Replace the `wsl.conf` writer · M · tier 0**
`assets/scripts/settings.bash`, `wsl.dart:1807-1846`, `settings_dialog.dart:399-433`. Read
with `getWSLConf`, mutate the model, write the whole file back in one in-distro command
through `wslShellArgs` with the payload escaped (or base64-encoded) — no `sed`, no per-key
string templating, which is what makes CC-1, CC-2 and CC-7 one fix rather than three.
`setSetting` must return the real exit status, and a failure must reach the user instead of
being swallowed by `showOutput: false`. Normalise section and key spelling on read so prefs
and widgets agree (V-7).
*Done when:* toggling `[interop] enabled` leaves `[automount] enabled` untouched;
`automount.root=/mnt/`, a `boot.command` containing slashes, and a `network.hostname`
containing a `"` all persist verbatim; a write to a read-only `/etc/wsl.conf` reports
failure rather than returning `true`; #185's and #309's repro steps pass.

**P05-04 — Tri-state booleans · S · tier 1 · hard-depends on P05-02**
`settings_screen.dart:1206-1215` and `settings_dialog.dart:346-370`. Unset must render as
the documented default with an "unset — default: on" affordance, not as off. Thirteen keys
across the two editors.
*This is not independently shippable.* [[coverage-sweep]] CC-11 established that the app
has **no way to remove a key from `.wslconfig`** — `saveSettings` skips empty values and
`setConfig` has no delete branch — so the third state has nowhere to be written until
P05-02 lands. Do not start P05-04 first.
*Done when:* a distro with no `wsl.conf` shows `automount.enabled` as on, Save does not
write keys the user never touched, and returning a key to *unset* physically removes its
line from `.wslconfig`.

**P05-05 — `[user] default` editor · S · tier 1**
Add a `[user]` section to `wslSettings` (`settings_dialog.dart:288-343`); the value already
reaches prefs through `loadDistroSettings` (`:413`) and is then dropped. Where WSL ≥ 2.5 is
present (P05-08), prefer `--manage --set-default-user` and fall back to writing the key —
`<distro> config --default-user` remains documented as broken for imported distros.
**Place it next to the existing *Start user* box and label both.** [[coverage-sweep]] S-1:
that box is tooltipped `wsldefaultuser-text` and only sets `--user` on terminals this app
launches, so it is what a user hunting for this setting finds instead — shipping a second
user field without distinguishing them makes the dialog worse, not better.
**Scope reduced.** The lifecycle half this item carried — "clear `StartUser_` / `StartPath_`
on deletion (#313)" — is **already implemented**: `clearDistroPrefs` (`helpers.dart:388`)
is called from `WSLApi.remove` (`wsl.dart:951`) and wipes all eleven per-distro prefixes on
unregister, and `loadDistroSettings` clears its twelve `wsl.conf` `knownKeys` on every
dialog open. Verify against #313 rather than reimplementing.
*Done when:* changing the default user in the dialog survives a `--terminate` and applies
to `wsl` typed in an external terminal, not just to launches from the app.

**P05-06 — `wsl.conf` dialog: restart scope, and stop writing per keystroke · S · tier 1**
Debounce or commit-on-blur instead of one in-distro script execution per character
(`settings_dialog.dart:358`, `:390`), and state the per-distro rule with a **Terminate
distro** button — `wsl --terminate <distro>` is sufficient here ([[runtime]] R-12); no
global shutdown is needed, which makes this cheaper than P05-07.
*Done when:* typing a 12-character hostname runs the writer once, and the dialog offers the
terminate that makes the change live.

**P05-07 — Global Settings: offer the restart on Save · S · tier 1**
`settings_screen.dart:1017`, `en.json:117`. Rewrite `globalconfigurationinfo-text` to say
changes take effect **after WSL restarts** — not "you may need to", which [[runtime]] R-11
measured as unconditional on this build — and fix "and ,later" and "take affect". Prompt
"Restart WSL now?" after Save, wired to the existing `WSLApi().restart()`.
*Done when:* the corrected string is present in all nine locales and Save offers the
restart.

**P05-08 — WSL capability service · M · tier 2**
One service that runs `wsl --version` and `wsl --status` once, caches the result, and
exposes `isStoreWsl`, `version` and `atLeast(2, 5)`. Read WSL's **stderr** as well as its
exit code: [[runtime]] R-1 shows `nestedVirtualization` is refused by the host CPU with a
warning no version check can predict, and the unknown-key diagnostics behind R-4 arrive on
the same channel. Surface WSL's own warnings instead of inventing gates.
*Done when:* the app shows its WSL version somewhere the user can find it, gates the
`--manage` items on it, and displays WSL's warning text when a key is refused.
*Scope note:* every **H** flag exists in 2.6.3 ([[runtime]] R-2), so one coarse "is this
2.x / ≥ 2.5" check is enough — do not build per-flag probing.

**P05-09 — `SettingsType.enumeration` · S · tier 2**
Add the member at `settings_screen.dart:20` and render a `ComboBox`; the pattern already
exists at `create_dialog.dart:522`, `mount_dialog.dart:334` and `:515` (V-2). Values:
`networkingMode` = `none | nat | bridged | mirrored | virtioproxy`, with `bridged` marked
deprecated since WSL 2.4.5; `autoMemoryReclaim` = `disabled | gradual | dropCache`.
*Done when:* neither key can be given an unrecognised value from the UI.

**P05-10 — Honour the five documented conditional dependencies · S · tier 2**
`dnsTunneling` → {`bestEffortDnsParsing`, `dnsTunnelingIpAddress`}; `autoProxy` →
`initialAutoProxyTimeout`; `networkingMode=mirrored` → {`ignoredPorts`,
`hostAddressLoopback`} **and** `localhostForwarding` becomes ignored; `networkingMode=NAT`
→ `dnsProxy`. Disable with a stated reason; do not hide.
*Done when:* selecting `mirrored` greys `localhostForwarding` with the documented reason
and enables its two dependants.

**P05-11 — Right widget for each documented value type · S · tier 2**
`swap` and `defaultVhdSize` get P05-01's size treatment; `vmIdleTimeout` and
`maxCrashDumpCount` get numeric input with the unit in the label (ms, count) and their
documented defaults as placeholders; `kernel` and `swapFile` get file pickers writing
through P05-02's escaping, so they do not reproduce CC-10 the way `kernelModules`' picker
does today.
*Done when:* no documented `size`, `number` or `path` key is an unvalidated free-text box.

**P05-12 — `.wslconfig` tooltip pass · S · tier 2**
Rewrite the 16 `outdated` and 1 `wrong` strings against [[verification]] Part 3: restore
every "Only applicable when…" clause and every default, restore `safeMode`'s WSL 0.66.2+
floor, delete `guiApplications`' invented Windows 11 restriction, restore "logical" to
`processors`, fix "Only available ,for Windows 11" and "take affect", and delete
`unusedmemoryinfo-text` from all nine locales (CC-8 — the residue of the key #225 and #234
reported).
*Done when:* the diff in [[verification]] Part 3 reads 27 covered.

**P05-13 — Labels, descriptions and i18n for the `wsl.conf` dialog · S · tier 2**
`settings_dialog.dart:346-397` renders `setting.uppercaseFirst()` and no description at
all. Give each of the eleven keys a localised label and description, including
`automount.options`' token list and the documented fact that `umask` / `fmask` / `dmask`
are inert without `metadata`.
*Done when:* no label in the dialog is derived from a Dart identifier.

**P05-14 — The four missing `wsl.conf` keys · S · tier 2**
`[gpu] enabled`, `[time] useWindowsTimezone`, `[boot] protectBinfmt` — `[user] default` is
P05-05. Write `protectBinfmt`'s description from behaviour, **not** from the upstream
sentence: the documented one is inverted (it describes the `false` case), as recorded in
[[wslconf-keys]].
*Done when:* all fifteen documented keys are editable.

**P05-15 — `wsl --manage --move` · M · tier 0, scheduled after P05-08**
Replace `WSLApi.move` (`wsl.dart:1649-1790`) with the native verb where available, keeping
the export → unregister → import path only as a fallback for older WSL, behind the same
size floor and prefs recovery marker it uses now. Either way, confirm destructively-shaped
operations before starting — #280 asked for precisely that.
*Done when:* a move on WSL ≥ 2.5 issues one `--manage --move` and never unregisters the
distro.

**P05-16 — Disk-space surface · M · tier 3**
Usage from `wsl --system df -h /mnt/wslg/distro` alongside the `ext4.vhdx` size the app
already reads for `move()`'s safety floor (`wsl.dart:1743-1757`); `--manage --resize`
(integers only — `2.5TB` is rejected); `--manage --set-sparse` for existing distros,
presented so it cannot be confused with `[experimental] sparseVhd`, which only affects new
ones. Add the free-space pre-check #303 asks for to the existing Compact action.
*Done when:* a user can see a distro's real usage, reclaim it, and cannot start a compact
that will not fit.

**P05-17 — Compressed exports · S · tier 3**
`--export --format tar.gz | tar.xz | vhd` (`wsl.dart:903-916`), with the format chosen in
the export UI, and `move()`'s intermediate no longer an uncompressed tar named `.ext4`.

**P05-18 — `--import-in-place` · S · tier 3**
`copyVhd()` (`wsl.dart:840-900`) file-copies `ext4.vhdx` and then `--import --vhd` copies
it a second time. Import the already-copied file in place.

**P05-19 — Default distro and WSL version verbs · S · tier 3**
`--set-default` (#268), `--set-version` per distro and `--set-default-version` (#103).
Gate on P05-08.

**P05-20 — One `--list --verbose` · S · tier 4**
Replaces the `--list --quiet` + `--list --running --quiet` pair (`wsl.dart:1294`, `:1564`)
and yields each distro's WSL version for free.

**P05-21 — Hygiene · S · tier 4**
Delete `WSLApi.install` (`wsl.dart:970-973`) — dead, and carrying the `-d` ≠ `--name` trap
`AGENTS.md` documents. Convert `mount_service.dart:248-292`'s string-built `--mount`
command to the `List<String>` form its own remote branch already uses, and drop the
pre-quoted path at `:313`.

**P05-22 — Resolve the "WSL Settings" name collision · S · tier 3**
`wslsettings-text` (`en.json:134`) names this app's **`wsl.conf`** dialog, while Windows
now ships a Start-menu app of that exact name editing **`.wslconfig`** (V-8). Rename this
app's dialog (e.g. "Distro Settings") across all nine locales, and reference Microsoft's
app by name on the screen that edits the same file it does.

**P05-23 — `wsl --update` from the app · M · tier 3**
Plus `--update --web-download` for machines where the Store is blocked
(`compare-versions.md:102`). Gate on P05-08, which is where the current version comes from.

**P05-24 — Custom-distro distribution · L · tier 3**
`.wsl` packaging, `wsl --install --from-file`, and `/etc/wsl-distribution.conf` —
`[oobe]`, `[shortcut]`, `[windowsterminal]`. The natural extension of the existing template
feature (`lib/api/templates.dart`, `lib/screens/template_screen.dart`), the documented
answer to #239 and #279, and the fix for the missing-launcher root cause behind #268.

### Research item, not implementation

**R-A — Benchmark against Microsoft's WSL Settings app.** [[features]] F-5's two open
questions cannot be answered from `microsoftdocs/wsl@8842def`, because the page does not
exist: which keys the first-party GUI exposes and with what widgets, and whether concurrent
editing of `%UserProfile%\.wslconfig` by both apps conflicts. Needs the shipping app or
`microsoft/WSL`. Worth doing **before** P05-11, as the natural benchmark for the widget-type
decisions — but not a blocker, since P05-11 already has the docs' value types.

## Phase 05 implementation record

Written 2026-08-28, at the end of Phase 05, from the code as it stands on `beta`. Read it
with the **Landed** columns above: those say where a finding went, this says what a whole
item did and — where it did not land in full — why.

### Shipped, 16 items

| 3 | `wsl.conf` writer | `lib/api/wsl_conf.dart` (new, over `ini_config.dart`); `wsl.dart:2097`–`:2166`; `assets/scripts/settings.bash` deleted; `test/wsl_conf_test.dart` |

| 8 | Capability service | `lib/api/wsl_capabilities.dart` (new); surfaced `settings_screen.dart:1194`–`:1253` |
| 9 | Enumeration widget | `settings_screen.dart:27`, `:1527` |

### Partial, 3 items — what is missing, and why

- **P05-05 — `[user] default`.** The editor shipped (`settings_dialog.dart:413`); the
  audit's *prefer `--manage --set-default-user` where WSL ≥ 2.5* half did not.
  `setDefaultUser` (`wsl.dart:2321`) exists and is tested but has **no caller**. Writing
  the key is the documented mechanism and the one that works for an imported distro, so
  the shipped behaviour is correct rather than a stopgap — the verb would only save a
  distro restart. Deferred as an **S** on top of a working feature, not as a gap.
- **P05-07 — restart on Save.** The *string* half landed with P05-12
  (`globalconfigurationinfo-text`, `en.json:117`, nine locales, no longer hedged). The
  *prompt* half did not: `saveSettings` (`settings_screen.dart:251`) still returns without
  offering `WSLApi().restart()`, and `restartwslnow-text` / `restartwslprompt-text`
  (`en.json:410`–`:411`) are translated in all nine locales but unreferenced. The screen
  does carry a separate **Stop WSL** button (`settings_screen.dart:218`), so the action is
  reachable — it is one click away and unprompted, which is exactly what R-11 called
  hedging. **This is the highest-value item left**: tier 1, one dialog, and the i18n is
  already done.
- **P05-17 — compressed exports.** `WSLApi.export` takes `format:` (`wsl.dart:1009`) and
  packaging passes `tar.gz`; no user-facing export path offers the choice. The API half
  was a by-product of P05-24, so what remains is UI only.

### Deferred, 5 items — all S, all tier 3–4

| # | Item | Why it was not done |
|---:|:---|:---|
| 18 | `--import-in-place` | Not started. An optimisation of `copyVhd()` — it removes one full-size VHD copy but changes no behaviour the user can see, and it touches the import path, which is the riskiest one to change without a running-app pass budgeted for it |
| 19 | `--set-default` / `--set-version` / `--set-default-version` | Not started. Depends on nothing that is missing — P05-08 shipped — so this is purely unspent budget. i18n is already seeded (`en.json:448`–`:449`), which makes it the cheapest of the five to pick up. Two open issues behind it (#103, #268) |
| 20 | One `--list --verbose` | Not started. A pure refactor of `wsl.dart:1682` with no user-visible change; tier 4 |
| 21 | Hygiene — delete `install()`, fix the two `--mount` argument strings | Not started. `wsl.dart:1088` is still dead code carrying the `-d` ≠ `--name` trap, and `mount_service.dart:248` / `:313` still hand-build their arguments. The trap itself is now documented in `AGENTS.md` and the correct form ships next to it (`installFromFile`), so the risk is lower than the audit measured — but not zero, because deleting dead code is not the same as it being gone |
| 22 | "WSL Settings" name collision | Not started, and it is the one deferral with an external dependency: **R-A was never run**. Renaming this app's dialog is a nine-locale user-visible rename, and the audit itself scheduled R-A (benchmark against Microsoft's app) before committing to how the two are distinguished. `microsoftwslsettings-text` (`en.json:450`) is already translated in nine locales, so half the work is banked |

**R-A — benchmark against Microsoft's WSL Settings app: not done.** It needs the shipping
first-party app, which was not available in this environment. F-5's two open questions —
which keys that GUI exposes, and whether concurrent editing of `%UserProfile%\.wslconfig`
by both apps conflicts — are still open.

### Found while implementing, not in the audit

Four defects that no pass of this audit predicted, all found by writing or running the
code, all fixed within Phase 05. Recorded here because the audit is meant to be a map of
what is true, and these were not on it:

- **Concurrent in-distro config writes lost each other.** `updateWSLConf` / `removeSetting`
  / `updateDistributionConf` / `removeDistributionSetting` are each a whole-file
  read-modify-write over `wsl.exe` taking a second or more, and the dialog writes per key,
  so a second edit started inside that window read the pre-edit file and put back a copy
  the first key was never in. Silent — both writes succeed. Fixed by
  `WSLApi._serialiseConfigWrite` (`wsl.dart:2125`), a static per-`'<distro>|<path>'` queue.
  Measured live against a real distro; documented in `AGENTS.md`.
- **An unreadable config file read as empty.** `readWslConfig` returning `''` instead of
  null meant an unreachable remote host's whole `.wslconfig` would be replaced by the one
  key the user touched on the next Save. Now null, with the caller refusing to write.
- **The write path's *destination* was shell syntax.** `writeDistroFile` base64s its
  payload, but `> $path` has to be shell for the redirection to happen and the path was
  interpolated raw. Guarded by `isPlainDistroPath` (`wsl_args.dart`), which refuses rather
  than quotes.
- **`move()`'s safety floor read a stale preference.** The export-size floor resolved the
  VHD through `getInstancePath`, so a stale `Path_<distro>` read as "no VHD" and dropped
  the floor from 10 MB to 1 MB — on exactly the large distros it exists to protect. Now
  `currentDistroPath` / `vhdxSizeBytes` (`wsl.dart:440`, `:447`) resolve through
  `findVhdxPath`.

## Not scheduled, with reasons

| Finding | Why not |
|:---|:---|
| `systemDistro`, `kernelDebugPort` | `intune.md`-only, no reference-table row; enterprise and kernel-debug plumbing, not settings-screen keys |
| S-4 `Default Distro Location` / `General Data Location` sharing the `_settings` map with `.wslconfig` keys | app preferences, not WSL config keys, and the name-match exclusion (`settings_screen.dart:309-310`) is correct today. Recorded in [[wslconfig-keys]] with verdict `n/a` so the coverage claim is complete; nothing to implement |
| F-7 WSL plugins | a developer-extension surface; no demand in 183 issues |
| `--shutdown --force` | documented as data-losing; the app already has a safe `--shutdown` |
| `--uninstall` | removes WSL itself; keeping it out of a distro manager's UI is deliberate |
| `--debug-shell` | requested once, in 2022 (#10, closed); diagnostic surface for plugin authors |
| `--list --online`, `--list --all` | the app ships its own catalogue (`images.json`, `distroRootfsLinks`) |
| `--import --version` | imports inherit the machine default; P05-19 gives the user that control directly |
| `--shell-type`, `--distribution-id` | `--exec` already solves the first; the app keys everything by name |
| `automount.options` decomposed editor | deferred, not rejected — P05-13 supplies the description and the `metadata` precondition, which is what the #224-class confusion needs. A per-token editor is an **M** with no reported demand |
| Intune policy detection | `*UserSettingConfigurable` can lock any `.wslconfig` key to its default (`intune.md:41-43`), which would make the app's writes silently ineffective. Real, unreachable from the docs clone, and no detection mechanism was found. Recorded so it is not rediscovered as a bug |
| WSL 1 behaviour (`case=force`, `--set-version 1`) | the app targets WSL 2; P05-19 exposes `--set-version` without adopting WSL 1 semantics anywhere else |

## New i18n keys the S-sized items need

Input to this phase's final task. Names follow the existing convention (lowercase, no
separators, `-text` suffix) and were checked against the 284 keys already in `en.json`:
`wsldefaultuser-text`, `stopwsl-text`, `selectfile-text`, `move-text` and `size-text`
already exist and should be reused rather than duplicated.

| Item | Keys |
|:---|:---|
| P05-04 | `settingdefault-text` ("Default"), `settingunset-text` ("Not set — using the default") |
| P05-05 | `defaultuserinfo-text`; reuse `wsldefaultuser-text` |
| P05-06 | `wslconfrestart-text` ("Restart this distro to apply"), `terminatedistro-text` |
| P05-07 | `restartwslnow-text`, `restartwslprompt-text`; **rewrite** `globalconfigurationinfo-text` |
| P05-09 | `deprecatedvalue-text` ("deprecated since WSL 2.4.5") |
| P05-10 | `onlyapplieswhen-text`, `ignoredinmirrored-text` |
| P05-11 | `milliseconds-text`, `unitexample-text` |
| P05-12 | **rewrites only** — 17 existing `*info-text` values; **delete** `unusedmemoryinfo-text` |
| P05-13 | 11 label + 11 description pairs for the `wsl.conf` keys (`bootsystemd-text` / `bootsystemdinfo-text`, `automountenabled-text` / `automountenabledinfo-text`, …) |
| P05-14 | `gpu-text`, `time-text`, `user-text` section headers; `gpuenabled-text`, `usewindowstimezone-text`, `protectbinfmt-text` and their `…info-text` pairs |
| P05-19 | `setdefaultdistro-text`, `setwslversion-text` |
| P05-22 | **rename** `wslsettings-text`; add `microsoftwslsettings-text` |

Roughly **45 new keys and 18 rewrites**, across nine locales. The three strings
[[verification]] corrected — `guiinfo-text`, `safemodeinfo-text`, `processorinfo-text` —
must be re-checked in **all** locales, not just `en.json`: only English was ever diffed.

**The ordered implementation list above is the Phase 05 input.** It covers every finding
in the seven files: 24 items (17 S · 6 M · 1 L), one research item, and twelve findings
explicitly not scheduled with a reason each.

The sanity check has since run ([[coverage-sweep]]) and **the item count did not change** —
its four additions folded into P05-02 and P05-05, its one withdrawal shrank P05-05, and it
added one hard dependency (**P05-04 cannot ship before P05-02**). What it did change is how
much weight the list can carry: "every key and every flag has a verdict" is now enumerated
rather than asserted.

One limit remains, stated here so the list is not read as more settled than it is: the
issue mapping is a match against reported symptoms, not a confirmed root-cause diagnosis
for each issue — #300 is marked *plausible*, not proven, and #313's mapping now needs
re-testing rather than implementing.

## Coverage limits

Each area file ends with its own "what was not examined" section; read it before quoting
a finding. [[coverage-sweep]]'s own section is the one to read before calling the audit
complete: it swept the two editors and `wsl.dart` end to end, but **not** `create_dialog.dart`,
`list_item.dart`, `docker_images.dart` or `copy_dialog.dart` (grepped for specific keys
only), and it re-checked the *app* side against the existing inventories without re-reading
the docs clone — so a documented key the first pass missed would still be invisible.

Two further limits apply to all four area files:

- **The four area files and [[verification]] were written without executing anything.**
  Every app-side claim in them is read from source at the cited line. [[runtime]] is the
  exception and supersedes them where they conflict: it executed WSL 2.6.3.0, wrote config
  keys and observed them taking effect. The app itself has still never been launched for
  this audit — see [[runtime]]'s *What was not examined*.
- **The docs are the yardstick, not the WSL implementation.** The inventories are
  exhaustive against `microsoftdocs/wsl@8842def` plus one local `wsl.exe --help` run. WSL
  has no "dump all config keys" verb, so a key that exists in the binary and in neither
  source is invisible to this audit — though [[runtime]]'s unknown-key probe can *test* any
  candidate name cheaply, which is how the two Intune-only keys were confirmed real.
