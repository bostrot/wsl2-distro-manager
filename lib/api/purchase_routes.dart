// Windows has had two: the Microsoft Store listing the app has always had,
// and — for buyers who would rather not go through the Store at all — the
// same website shop the Mac uses, which sells a licence key instead. macOS
// has only the website, since there is no Store to sell through.
//
// Once the Store listing goes free it sells nothing, and Windows is left
// with the website too: the same single card the Mac shows, at the Windows
// price. Nothing sends a buyer to a Store page that cannot take their money.
//
// The copy lives here as i18n keys rather than strings so the screen stays a
// plain renderer and the route set itself is testable without a UI.
