// What the installed `wsl.exe` can actually do, asked once and cached.
//
// ## Why this file exists
//
// Before P05-08 neither `wsl --version` nor `wsl --status` was invoked
// anywhere in `lib/` (doc/audit/wsl-docs/cli-flags.md CC-1), with three
// consequences the audit calls the enabling finding of the whole phase:
//
// * Every version floor the audit records — Windows 11, WSL 0.66.2+, 2.0.9+,
//   2.5+ — was unenforceable. `hostAddressLoopback` and `safeMode` rendered
//   identically on a machine that could honour neither.
// * `systemd.md:30` documents the canonical probe for the Store build:
//   inbox WSL *rejects* `--version`, the Store build answers it. Without that
//   the app could not warn that `--manage`, `--mount --name` or the
//   `[experimental]` keys are unavailable.
// * "Which WSL do I have" was not answerable anywhere in the UI.
//
// The second half of this file is the part a version number cannot replace.
// wsl.exe reports refused keys, an unsupported host CPU and clamped values on
// **stderr, with exit code 0** (runtime R-1, R-4, R-9). A gate built purely on
// a version string invents an answer where WSL is already giving a real one, so
// [WslCapabilities.warnings] carries WSL's own words through to the user.
