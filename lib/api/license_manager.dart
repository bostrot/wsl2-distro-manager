// Pro entitlement, from one of two places depending on where the app came
// from.
//
// Windows: the app has been a one-time Microsoft Store purchase, and being
// installed from the Store *is* the licence, detected via MSIX package
// identity. The portable GitHub build runs unpackaged and stays free.
//
// That equation only holds while the listing costs money. When it stops —
// see [storeFreeFromUtc] — a Store install is just a download, and Pro on
// Windows is bought the same way it is on the Mac. Every Store install that
// predates the flip keeps Pro for good: [storeGrandfathers] decides that
// once, and the answer is written down rather than re-derived, so it cannot
// be lost to a later release. When nothing local proves the purchase — a
// buyer reinstalling on a fresh PC — the Store's own record of when the app
// was acquired is asked for through the runner ([restoreFromStore]).
//
// macOS: there is no Store and no package identity, so Pro is bought on
// wslmanager.com and arrives as a licence key — typed in, or handed over by
// the browser through `wslmanager://license?key=...` after checkout. The key
// is validated once against the licence service and then cached, so the app
// keeps working offline.
//
// A key comes with seats — one for Pro — and the service hands them to
// installs, newest activation first. Every request names this install with a
// random id made here (see [_deviceId]) and says whether the user typed the
// key in or the app is re-checking it in the background; a re-check from an
// install that lost its seat comes back invalid, which is how a key shared
// between two PCs keeps bouncing between them.
//
// Neither path is protection. The repo is open source; both are a nudge.
